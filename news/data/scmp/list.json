            "title": "Are new Hong Kong subdivided flat standards triggering a wave of evictions?",
            "description": "Hongkonger Chan Sai-chiu considers the 60 sq ft subdivided flat he rents to be home, going out of his way to make the cramped space in Sham Shui Po’s ageing Yee Wa Building more liveable by repainting the walls and setting up his own kitchen.\nThe 72-year-old considers the flat’s HK$3,000 (US$383) rent to be a perfect fit for his tight budget, as he lives off about HK$5,000 from social security payments and receives a rental subsidy of HK$2,500.\nThe building also suits the retiree, who is chronically ill and struggles to walk, because it has lifts and is only 500 metres (1,640 feet) away from a local wet market.\nBut Chan was caught by surprise last December, just in the middle of his two-year contract, when landlords for the building gave more than 200 households three months to move out.\nThe decision was prompted by renovation plans to ensure the properties complied with the Basic Housing Units Ordinance, which takes effect on Sunday.\nThe new law stipulates that only “basic housing units”, referring to certified subdivided homes that meet the new minimum standards, can be leased on the market.\nBut authorities are allowing landlords to lease substandard properties while getting four years to make rectifications.\n“The owners have exploited our rights. I have to stand up for myself,” Chan said.\n“Under the new law, unless the government has accommodation arrangements for tenants, there will be evictions forever.”\nThe Yee Wa Building case is just the tip of the iceberg since lawmakers voted to approve the new regulatory regime last September.\n\n\nAs the Basic Housing Units Ordinance takes effect, advocates and professionals have called for ensuring a stable supply of temporary accommodation for subdivided housing tenants likely to be uprooted, along with a comprehensive enforcement plan to plug loopholes.\nThere are currently about 220,000 residents living in subdivided homes.\nAn earlier government survey also estimates that around 33,000 subdivided flats – 30 per cent of the city’s total – would require significant fixes before they could be deemed basic housing units.\nIn the case of Yee Wa Building residents, authorities stepped in a month after the eviction was announced. But the issue has yet to be fully resolved.\nThe Housing Bureau deployed an NGO to offer help after Chan and tenants made headlines in January.\nWhile the owners claimed to have earlier offered a three-to-12-month grace period to tenants, the bureau said the landlords were still exploring the arrangement and that the NGO would assist residents in moving to temporary housing or seeking other private properties.\nAccording to the bureau, as of late February, among the 138 households it had contacted, 43 had applied for transitional flats, 10 had moved to light public housing, and 39 had their applications approved to stay at a hostel offering single-person rooms just a five-minute walk from their old homes.\nAngela Lui Yi-shan, a community organiser at the Society for Community Organisation, noted that some building residents had already been evicted before such incidents had come to light.\nSuch residents had moved to other substandard homes in the district, meaning that they would be uprooted again when the operators decided to fix the flats to meet legal requirements.\nLui said low-income individuals and two-person households, such as the elderly and single-parent families, would be hit hardest under the new regulatory regime.\n\nLui said such residents could only rent small, substandard properties with rents of about HK$3,000 and could not afford a basic housing unit, which must be at least 86 sq ft, have a proper window and come with an individual toilet, among other requirements.\nShe noted that rents for subdivided flats of a better quality were naturally higher, and their leases could increase by 5 to 15 per cent following renovations.\n“Those with the lowest purchasing power and or the most underprivileged may have to resort to renting a substandard flat on the black market or resort to bed-space flats,” she said.\n“The law aims to improve living quality … but we need to observe whether the living quality has been downgraded in some cases.”\nTenants affected by the new law can apply for temporary housing, subject to availability.\nResidents who have waited for a public rental home for at least three years can apply for the light public housing homes built by the government, while others can apply for flats under the transitional housing scheme introduced in 2018.\nSecretary for Housing Winnie Ho Wing-yin earlier said around 4,000 transitional flats were reserved for affected subdivided flat tenants, and was exploring increasing the supply of such homes in urban areas.\nAs of December, around 16,690 transitional flats are in operation, and another 2,700 are set to be built by 2027.\nLui said that the government could only eradicate substandard housing and regulate the subdivided housing market effectively with sufficient housing supply and strong enforcement, as tenants tended to stay quiet rather than risk losing their homes.\n“Tenants tend not to report substandard properties as they can lose their homes, especially when they may not find a resettlement suitable to their needs. It is not ideal if the report burden lies on tenants,” she said.\n\n\n\n\nRobin Leung Chi-tim, the immediate past president of the Hong Kong Institute of Surveyors, echoed the need for a comprehensive enforcement plan, as authorities would only start taking action from March 2027.\nHe said authorities would have a list of operators registered for the three-year grace period, but they would be kept in the dark about landlords who did not apply and were leasing their properties illegally.\nLeung also observed another possible loophole after the grace period, as the new law only regulated two or more subdivided housing tenancies in a flat.\nA homeowner could claim that they only leased one subdivided home and were living in the rest of the space, but were actually letting out their properties to several tenants, he said.\n“It can be difficult to prove. Officers have to go undercover. Authorities have to devise effective enforcement actions,” he said.\nWhile many of his neighbours have since moved out, Chan said he found relocating to transitional housing in the New Territories inconvenient and expressed reluctance to share a kitchen with other tenants in a nearby hostel.\nHe has queued for public rental housing for three years and is eligible for a light public home, but he does not know when he will be allocated a temporary flat.\n“It can take eight or 10 months. I have nowhere to go,” Chan said.\n",

            "title": "Hong Kong’s small landlords turn to co-working, student hostels to survive",
            "description": "Hong Kong’s struggling office landlords are ramping up efforts to convert their assets into co-working spaces and student accommodation in a bid to adapt to intense competition and the flight to quality, according to analysts.\nWith some 3.5 million sq ft of new premium office space expected to be completed this year and next, on top of the 4.5 million sq ft added in 2024 and 2025, tenants are increasingly choosing to relocate to new and modern offices, leading to diverging fortunes for big established landlords and non-premium asset owners.\n“The persistent ‘flight to quality’ creates a profound and escalating challenge for owners of older, non-prime office buildings,” said Jack Tong, director for research and consultancy at Savills Hong Kong.\n“As corporates from high-value sectors consolidate into modern, ESG [environmental, social and governance]-compliant buildings, the demand for secondary space contracts to smaller local businesses, back-office functions and start-ups – all of which are highly price sensitive and have more options.”\nThis situation is forcing landlords to offer significant rent concessions to keep tenants.\n“For [many] landlords, asset obsolescence is no longer a distant risk but an immediate threat to cash flow and asset viability,” Tong said.\nGiven the situation, proactive landlords are exploring strategies such as repositioning their assets and converting underutilised office floors into co-working spaces and student accommodation.\n“We have seen a recent rebound in co-working space requirements, with total co-working leased floor space amounting to 1.7 million sq ft in 2025, 50 per cent higher than in 2017 when the market was consolidating,” Tong said.\nLandlords were becoming more active in the segment, setting up their co-working operations in their own premises to provide a full leasing ecosystem, according to Tong.\n\nFor example, in 2024, CK Asset Holdings, one of Hong Kong’s largest landlords and developers, launched CK Office Suites to manage a co-working office space on the 45th floor of Cheung Kong Center in Central.\nThe conversion to student housing was also gathering pace because of a huge supply-and-demand imbalance in the sector, according to Savills, which estimated an 88,000-student-bed deficit in Hong Kong currently.\n“The latest Hostel in the City Scheme reveals 25 applications were received under the scheme, involving an addition of 5,100 beds, of which 23 were commercial conversions and two new builds,” Tong said.\nRecently, the owners of Rich China Center, a grade B building in Kwun Tong, applied to the Town Planning Board to convert the asset into a student hostel, providing 117 rooms with a total of 225 beds. The South China Morning Post has reached out to the owners of Rich China Center for comment.\nMeanwhile, the city’s office property market was showing signs of stability, with net absorption of 2.1 million sq ft in 2025, the most since 2018, according to CBRE. Net absorption refers to the total amount of space taken up minus the space left vacant by tenants.\nCentral recorded the biggest improvement with a net absorption of 234,800 sq ft in the fourth quarter, the highest for the city’s main business hub since the second quarter of 2015. Net absorption for the full year stood at 496,000 sq ft, the best annual gain since 2007, CBRE said.\nDespite the pickup in leasing, overall office rents in the city fell 2.9 per cent year on year, the least since 2019, the property consultancy added.\n\n\nDemand mainly came from financial companies, accounting for 69 per cent and 62 per cent of total take-up in the last two quarters of 2025, according to Knight Frank.\nAs a result, premium offices in Central are expected to outperform the broader market this year, with rents likely to rise by as much as 8 per cent, while rents on Hong Kong Island could fall by as much as 5 per cent, Knight Frank added.\nBesides repurposing, small landlords can also survive the tough leasing environment by “enhancing competitiveness through selective and cost-effective upgrades rather than full-scale redevelopment”, said Keith Chan, economist for research and consultancy for Greater China at Knight Frank.\n“Improvements to lobbies, lift systems, building services and ESG-related features can materially uplift tenant perception,” he said.\n“Such repositioning may help capture niche demand from occupiers such as family offices, boutique financial firms and professional services, whose preferences are shifting towards higher-quality, well-managed and more efficient office environments.”\n",

            "title": "Breakthrough or hype? How WeRide aims to edge rivals in crowded robotaxi fieldWeRide says its world model has slashed costs to support global expansion, but investors question if it can deliver a last",
            "description": "WeRide, one of China’s big three robotaxi companies, has cut research and development (R&amp;D) costs by “millions” of US dollars by using artificial intelligence to train its fleet in virtual worlds, its CEO said.\nWhile rivals had also developed AI models simulating the physical world, WeRide’s efforts stood out as it was using its world model Genesis to support its global expansion strategy, said Tony Han.\n“It’s the first real marriage between physical AI and generative AI,” Han told the South China Morning Post.\nA major challenge for the autonomous vehicle industry has been the high costs associated with developing self-driving algorithms that can generalise across different markets and terrains.\nIn particular, the low tolerance for accidents has meant algorithms must be trained on many low-probability “edge cases” that occur in the real world, as shown by a recent incident in the US where a Waymo robotaxi drove passengers into a police stand-off.\n\nThis has pushed many of the industry’s leading players, including Waymo and Tesla, to turn to AI world models as they seek to reduce unit costs to drive fleet expansion.\nIn China, Guangzhou-based WeRide and crosstown rival Pony.ai have both emphasised their world model efforts in recent months, as they look to keep up with Baidu’s Apollo Go, the domestic leader by fleet size.\nHan said Genesis had allowed WeRide to test new self-driving algorithms in a matter of days in a virtual world, where previously the same tests would have required hundreds of cars operating in the real world for months.\nCrucially, Genesis enables WeRide engineers to simulate rare edge cases that are key to ensuring self-driving safety yet difficult to capture in the real world.\nThis had resulted in a reduction of at least 75 per cent in WeRide’s data labelling and collection costs, Han said, adding that such costs made up a large percentage of the company’s R&amp;D spending – around 316 million yuan (US$46 million) in the third quarter of 2025, or around 73 per cent of total operating expenses.\nHan said Genesis was almost entirely the result of advancements in generative AI technology in recent years. The company’s early experiments with physical world simulations had been rudimentary, with cars and pedestrians represented by Roblox-like blocks, limiting practical usefulness.\nThis changed as generative AI, which uses machine learning to create models of its underlying datasets, made virtual worlds increasingly accurate depictions of the real world.\n\nWeRide trained Genesis using billions of kilometres of real-world driving data collected by the company, including more than eight years of real-world edge cases. Its powerful capabilities mean WeRide could sell the model as a stand-alone product in future – a long-standing “dream” for Han, a former chief scientist of autonomous driving at Baidu.\nHan said limits on access to computational power, more than rising graphics processing unit (GPU) prices, were now the main obstacle to continued improvement, given the clear upside of investment in this area for WeRide’s bottom line.\n“Every dollar we spend improving Genesis leads to 10 times more R&amp;D efficiency, because it’s less spent on road testing and recruiting data labourers,” he said, adding they were now “probably” doubling their GPU stock every quarter. “The constraint is the shortage of memory and availability of certain advanced GPUs.”\nWith the help of AI, WeRide aims to ramp up its global fleet from around 1,000 today to up to 3,000 robotaxis by the end of this year.\nHowever, investors have shown concern for WeRide’s future in a crowded field. Apollo Go and Pony.ai aside, Chinese start-ups such as AutoX and Momenta have also recently expanded pilot programmes, while Volkswagen announced this week its plans to launch its first robotaxi fleet in the US.\nSince its November listing, WeRide’s Hong Kong shares have fallen more than 20 per cent, while its Nasdaq shares have slumped almost 70 per cent in the past year. Analysts have highlighted the company’s continued R&amp;D-driven losses as a point of concern, with profitability not expected until 2030.\n\nIt remains uncertain whether Genesis will give WeRide an edge over rivals, with Pony.ai recently touting that its world model PonyWorld generates 10 billion kilometres for testing each week.\nLeading US player Waymo also unveiled its world model earlier this month, built on Google DeepMind’s most powerful world model Genie 3. It said the collaboration with its fellow Alphabet subsidiary gave its model an edge over others in the autonomous vehicle industry, as Genie 3 was trained on a huge number of videos and not just real-world driving data.\nBeyond technical indicators, Han pointed to WeRide’s aggressive global expansion strategy as a differentiator from its competitors, as the strategy could be further enhanced with a powerful world model even if it was not industry-leading.\nWhile WeRide still lags far behind Baidu’s Apollo Go in domestic deployment, the company has already expanded to more than 40 cities across 11 countries and regions, one of the highest in the world, compared with eight for Pony.ai and three for Waymo.\nThe company struck a deal last year with Grab, the largest ride-hailing app in Southeast Asia, and announced a major expansion of its partnership with Uber earlier this month to deploy at least 1,200 robotaxis across the Middle East as soon as 2027.\nMeanwhile, Baidu said on Thursday that Apollo Go had reached 26 cities globally.\n“Genesis for us makes sense from a business expansion perspective,” said Han. “It allows us to more easily get into a new country or market without having to do all the hard work of collecting new road data.”\nWith earnings coming up on March 23, investors could expect to see a Genesis-powered boost to the company’s financial health, he said. “I think we will have very good numbers.”\n",

            "description": "Major Hong Kong developer Sino Land posted a steady net profit for the six months ended December, propped up by early gains from a recovery in the city’s residential property market.\nSino Land reported a net profit of HK$2.22 billion (US$284 million) in the first half of its current financial year – excluding revaluation losses on investment properties – that was slightly down from HK$2.24 billion a year earlier, according to its Hong Kong stock exchange filing on Friday.\nThe company’s revenue rose 34.5 per cent to HK$5.19 billion from HK$3.85 billion a year ago. Revenue from property sales, including sales of associates and joint ventures, jumped 2.8 times to HK$6.91 billion from HK$2.45 billion in the same period in 2024.\nTaking into account a HK$682 million revaluation loss on investment properties, the developer earned HK$1.53 billion in the period, down from HK$1.82 billion a year ago.\n“I am encouraged by the clear improvement in both the economic and operating environment,” chairman Daryl Ng Win Kong said in the filing, citing the interest-rate-cut cycle, Hong Kong’s talent admission scheme and mainland China’s national economic blueprint for bolstering the property sector.\nDelivering his first earnings after taking over the chairman role from his father, Ng highlighted the city’s encouraging property sales performance in the second half of 2025, which delivered proceeds of HK$6.5 billion.\nThe developer’s results come as the city’s housing market showed signs of stabilising. Home prices have climbed 3.7 per cent so far this year, according to the Centaline City Leading Index, after gaining 1.6 per cent in January.\n\nTransaction volumes have also strengthened. Primary home sales surged to a seven-year high in January, reaching about 1,500 units – up 101 per cent year on year – while secondary sales hit an eight-year high at 4,100 units, a 44 per cent increase from a year ago.\nSino Land’s shares edged down 0.1 per cent to HK$12.78 on Friday, but rose 25 per cent this year. Out of the 12 analysts’ recommendations of the stock tracked on Bloomberg, 10 suggested “Buy” and two said “Hold”.\nThe company has two new residential projects in the pipeline: one in Tseung Kwan O and another at Wing Kwong Street in To Kwa Wan that is being co-developed with the Urban Renewal Authority.\nLast month, a joint venture between Sino Land and Great Eagle Holdings won a government residential site tender in Kowloon for HK$1.61 billion, outbidding major Hong Kong developers. It followed another tender win in Tuen Mun for HK$1.09 billion last August.\n“With interest rates on a downward trajectory, we will continue to strategically allocate our cash resources and actively pursue opportunities,” Ng said.\nSino Land declared an interim dividend of HK$0.15 per share to be payable either by cash or shares on April 23.\nProfit at the company’s Sino Hotels unit – owner of City Garden Hotel in Fortress Hill, Conrad Hong Kong in Admiralty and the Royal Pacific Hotel &amp; Towers in Tsim Sha Tsui – increased 19.3 per cent in the six months to December to HK$51.9 million from HK$43.5 million a year earlier, according to a separate disclosure.\nTsim Sha Tsui Properties, another listed company under the Sino Group, recorded a 13 per cent drop in profit to HK$905 million from HK$1.04 billion in the year-earlier period.\n",

Net absorption for the full year stood at 496,000 sq ft, the best annual gain since 2007, CBRE said.\nDespite the pickup in leasing, overall office rents in the city fell 2.9 per cent year on year, the least since 2019, the property consultancy added.\n\n\nDemand mainly came from financial companies, accounting for 69 per cent and 62 per cent of total take-up in the last two quarters of 2025, according to Knight Frank.\nAs a result, premium offices in Central are expected to outperform the broader market this year, with rents likely to rise by as much as 8 per cent, while rents on Hong Kong Island could fall by as much as 5 per cent, Knight Frank added.\nBesides repurposing, small landlords can also survive the tough leasing environment by “enhancing competitiveness through selective and cost-effective upgrades rather than full-scale redevelopment”, said Keith Chan, economist for research and consultancy for Greater China at Knight Frank.\n“Improvements to lobbies, lift systems, building services and ESG-related features can materially uplift tenant perception,” he said.\n“Such repositioning may help capture niche demand from occupiers such as family offices, boutique financial firms and professional services, whose preferences are shifting towards higher-quality, well-managed and more efficient office environments.”\n",

            "title": "The big cornerstone comeback: what’s driving investors back to Hong Kong IPOs?",
            "description": "Until last year, Fidelity International’s most significant cornerstone commitments on the Hong Kong initial public offering (IPO) market dated back to 2021, when Chinese short-video platform Kuaishou Technology raised US$5.4 billion and healthcare firm Medlive Technology completed a US$543.4 million listing.\nThen for the next four years, the asset manager went quiet.\nLate last year it returned to Chinese assets in force. It backed gold miner Zijin Gold International’s US$3.2 billion listing in September 2025, followed by crypto platform HashKey Group, snack retailer Busy Ming and pork giant Muyuan Foods.\nFidelity’s comeback is not an isolated case.\nHeavyweight global investors such as BlackRock, Temasek and Qatar Investment Authority are reappearing in cornerstone books, signalling a shift in sentiment – and raising the question of what has changed in Hong Kong’s favour.\n“We have seen a robust comeback of international long-only investors – especially European and Middle Eastern sovereign funds – in Hong Kong’s IPO market, and we expect that momentum to carry into 2026,” said John Lee, vice-chairman and head of Greater China for global banking at UBS.\nThe return is not limited to Europe and the Middle East, with US and Singapore-based funds also re-emerging as cornerstone backers in major listings, particularly across consumption, industrial and hi-tech sectors.\n“In 2023 and 2024, many international investors reduced China exposure altogether,” Lee said. “But the tone has definitely changed over the past 12 to 18 months, with a gradual return of investors adding back China weightings – a trend that became more pronounced by the middle of 2025.”\nThe shift has been supported by improving sentiment towards consumption, clearer policy direction in technology and industrial upgrading, and growing confidence in the global competitiveness of Chinese companies, particularly in artificial intelligence and advanced manufacturing, he added.\nHong Kong’s equity market delivered its strongest annual gains since 2017 last year, supported by improved liquidity and renewed risk appetite. Benchmarks outpaced several major developed-market indices, while valuations remained well below those of US peers.\nFor investors such as Fidelity International, the move reflects a strong recalibration of risk appetite.\n“The Hong Kong IPO market today feels more anchored by companies listing for longer-term strategic reasons rather than short-term fundraising considerations,” said Tina Tian, portfolio manager at Fidelity International.\nFrom a risk-reward perspective, it felt like the right time to re-engage with Hong Kong, she added, noting that from both an issuer and investor perspective the quality and structure of the IPO pipeline had improved materially.\n“As global regulatory and geopolitical dynamics evolved, a Hong Kong IPO or secondary listing is increasingly seen as a way to broaden the investor base, enhance liquidity and maintain access to international capital within a familiar regulatory framework,” Tian said.\nThe cornerstone investor has long been a steady feature of Hong Kong’s IPO market, offering much-needed ballast to a market prone to sharp swings.\nWith early commitments to buy sizeable stakes and lock-up periods after listing, cornerstone funds anchor pricing, signal confidence and help stabilise deals before trading begins.\nForeign capital accounted for about 27 per cent of all 353 cornerstone investors across the top 20 IPOs of 2025 and those priced up to February 3, this year, according to data compiled by the SCMP.\nTheir presence has grown not only in headcount but also in investment size, with commitments noticeably larger than in 2022.\n“Large scale US funds are leaning into China’s consumption, infrastructure and industrial sectors,” a shift away from their earlier preference for property developers, said George Wu, partner at global law firm DLA Piper.\nThe contrast in cornerstone investor profiles between recent and older deals is stark.\nWhen China Tourism Group Duty Free raised US$2.3 billion in August 2022, the year’s largest IPO in Hong Kong, its cornerstone line-up was dominated by state-backed funds, including China State-owned Enterprise Mixed Ownership Reform Fund and China Structural Reform Fund.\nFast forward to last year, and the names tell a different story.\nMainland Chinese soft drink maker Eastroc Beverage, which raised US$1.3 billion in the city’s largest IPO as of February 3, drew 16 cornerstone investors, including six global heavyweights such as sovereign wealth fund Qatar Investment Authority – the single largest cornerstone investor with US$150 million – alongside Temasek, BlackRock, Fidelity and JPMorgan Asset Management.\nBlackRock put US$35 million into snack retailer Busy Ming. In industrials, Oaktree and Jane Street joined BlackRock in backing machinery maker Sany Heavy Industry, while Jane Street also took a cornerstone stake in air-conditioning components supplier Zhejiang Sanhua Intelligent Controls.\nMiddle Eastern sovereign wealth funds have been among the most active backers of China’s cutting-edge technology listings.\nAbu Dhabi Investment Authority was the largest cornerstone investor in AI start-up MiniMax with a US$65 million commitment and also led the cornerstone line-up in Shenzhen Edge Medical with US$15 million.\nKuwait Investment Authority ranked among the biggest cornerstone investors in battery giant Contemporary Amperex Technology, pledging US$500 million.\n“The direction of private capital flows is driven mainly by financial returns,” Wu said. “But in certain sensitive tech areas, geopolitical and national security concerns inevitably discourage some investors from taking action.”\n\n\n\n\nM&amp;G Investments, the London-based asset manager, was involved last year in the listings of logistics firm Jingdong Industrials and bubble tea chain Mixue Group as a cornerstone investor.\n“Our intention is to be long-term shareholders from the outset,” said Vikas Pershad, portfolio manager for Asian equities at M&amp;G Investments.\n“We see compelling opportunities in several areas: the renewables supply chain, scaled franchise-driven business models expanding domestically and internationally, technology platforms and logistics companies.\n“The common characteristics across these sectors are wide competitive moats, improving unit economics, robust balance sheets, long growth runways and valuations that remain discounted relative to global peers.”\nThe share of IPO proceeds locked up by cornerstone investors also climbed between 2021 and 2026, with the portion of total funds rising to roughly 49 per cent from about 14 per cent, according to LSEG Data &amp; Analytics data.\nMore than 270 global institutions acted as cornerstone investors in Hong Kong IPOs last year, while 40 listings included at least one international cornerstone backer, Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing (HKEX) data showed.\nSo far in 2026, cornerstone tranches have accounted for around half of the US$1.81 billion raised across 11 Hong Kong IPOs.\nFor many global long-only investors, the renewed participation as cornerstone investors marks a clear break from the years when exposure to Chinese equities – and Hong Kong IPOs in particular – was sharply reduced or frozen altogether.\n“That said, state-linked capital helped companies bridge a difficult funding period and reach the IPO stage,” Wu said. “At the same time, local governments were advancing industrial upgrading amid property downturn and sluggish consumption, and companies urgently needed capital between 2022 and 2024. It was a very reasonable match.”\n“The direction of Chinese government capital flows is about supporting local industries, promoting employment and creating local social and economic value,” he added.\nGovernment-backed entities made up about 18 per cent of all cornerstone investors across the largest IPOs of 2025 and those priced up to February 3, this year.\nWhile Chinese government-linked investment vehicles have scaled back their overall share of cornerstone allocations during 2022 and 2024, they continue to anchor the country’s strategic sectors such as artificial intelligence, semiconductors, electric vehicles and new energy.\nAnalysts said their holdings underscored China’s push to shift away from property-driven growth towards new economic engines.\nSeveral semiconductor and biotech deals this year saw meaningful government participation. For instance, cornerstone investors in OmniVision Integrated Circuits, GigaDevice Semiconductor and Shanghai Iluvatar CoreX Semiconductor all included state-linked funds.\nWhile state backing has supported demand in strategic sectors, the broader revival in cornerstone activity has been driven by the return of international investors alongside reforms introduced by Hong Kong’s bourse operator.\nHKEX, which runs Asia’s third-largest stock market with a capitalisation of about US$6.5 trillion, has in recent years introduced a series of listing changes aimed at widening the pipeline of issuers and expanding the base of institutional investors.\n\n\nIts IPO allocation overhaul, effective August 4, guaranteed institutional investors at least 40 per cent of new shares through the bookbuilding tranche while cutting the potential clawback to the retail subscription pool to 35 per cent from 50 per cent under the old rules, a move aimed at reducing volatility in debut trading.\nThe growing prevalence of so-called A+H listings and “return-to-Hong Kong” transactions has also meant that investors are increasingly engaging with companies that are already well researched and subject to regulatory oversight in other major markets, helping to rebuild confidence in deal quality.\nThat shift has been reinforced by changes to the listing regime. Since 2018, HKEX has introduced Chapter 18A and, more recently, Chapter 18C to accommodate pre-revenue biotech and specialist technology companies, widening the pipeline of issuers and drawing fresh pools of capital.\nJohnson Chui, managing director and head of global issuer services at HKEX, said the increasingly diverse mix of participants in IPOs reflected investor confidence in Hong Kong as a resilient and internationally competitive capital-raising venue.\n“HKEX will continue to enhance its attractiveness to global investors,” he said.\nAccording to Peihao Huang, head of equity capital markets for Asia Pacific at J.P. Morgan, cornerstone investors were essential to issuers and banks in setting valuation parameters, identifying opinion-leading institutions and reducing execution risk and helping build momentum during book-building.\nShe added that the presence of well-known international cornerstone investors often strengthened demand from other institutional and retail investors, as their participation was widely viewed as a validation of deal quality and valuation discipline.\n“Cornerstone participation has always been a defining feature of Hong Kong IPOs, but in this cycle it has become the new norm,” she said.\n",

            "title": "Hi-tech aids proposed to help elderly climb stairs to fire-ravaged Tai Po flats",
            "description": "Some anxious residents of fire-ravaged Wang Fuk Court have urged Hong Kong authorities to help them climb stairs using makeshift aids when they return to their high-rise homes to collect personal belongings next month.\nSome lawmakers also proposed on Saturday that the government deploy wearable walking robots, stair-climbing trolleys or wheelchairs to assist elderly residents of the Tai Po estate devastated by the inferno that claimed 168 lives and displaced nearly 5,000 people in November.\nThey raised the suggestions as some worried residents scrambled for ways to navigate the stairs of blocks, which are more than 30 storeys high.\nOne resident said he would write to officials to lobby for the installation of ramps over stairs to ease access and transport of larger items.\nDeputy Chief Secretary Warner Cheuk Wing-hing said on Thursday that residents of the seven fire-damaged blocks could return to collect personal belongings in late April at the earliest.\n\n\n\n\nAccess will be via rear stairs only, as lifts remain inoperative after the fire. Residents have been advised to retrieve only valuable and portable items.\nCheuk said more details could be announced in March.\nA homeowner named Mr Lee suggested placing ramps over the stairs.\n“Officials can’t just sit back and let the victims find the ways on their own,” Lee said.\n“Some residents may have to climb stairs for 20 to 30 storeys to get back home. Even if they can make it to their homes, it is almost impossible to carry belongings down 20 to 30 storeys again.”\nLee added: “We could put 12-inch-wide wooden boards over the stairs to let residents pull up or slide their heavy items or suitcases down the flights of stairs. It won’t cost the government much.”\nHe said he would write to lobby officials.\nLawmaker Scott Leung Man-kwong, deputy chairman of the Legislative Council’s housing panel, agreed the government should offer help.\n“Letting residents return to check their homes is good. But some practical arrangements are needed,” he said.\n“Volunteers from disciplined services could help bring down some heavy stuff. We can also use technology to help, like exoskeletons or stair-climbing trolleys.”\nAn exoskeleton is a wearable motorised robotic frame that enhances the wearer’s strength, endurance and mobility by supporting their joints and muscles. A stair-climbing trolley is a machine with a loading board for transporting heavy or bulky items up or down stairs.\nFellow legislator Michelle Tang Ming-sum, of the Business and Professionals Alliance for Hong Kong, shared Leung’s views.\n“These are common AgeTech devices, readily available on the market. The government can simply rent them,” Tang said.\n\n\nHowever, homeowner David Wong expressed doubt over the need for such equipment.\n“We are not going to bring down a washing machine or a TV set. Understandably, most things inside were already burned to ash,” he said.\n“The government’s move was meant to allow us to go back home to pick up portable and valuable items only,” said Wong, who hoped to be able to retrieve some old family photos.\nAnother owner, Ms Chong, said she would ask her son to go back to check her flat’s condition. “I don’t think I would dare go up. Seeing my home burned to such a state would leave a very painful memory,” she said.\nUndersecretary for Labour and Welfare Ho Kai-ming said ensuring that residents could return home safely was the government’s top priority. “After the plan is finalised, we shall contact the residents through social workers,” Ho said.\nThe fire engulfed seven of Wang Fuk Court’s eight blocks, burning for about 43 hours. The tragedy prompted authorities to provide temporary accommodation to those affected.\nMeanwhile, Food for Good, operator of a transitional housing project in Kai Tak, hosted a Chinese New Year “poon choi” festival meal for Wang FuK Court residents staying there.\nGroup founder Regina Leung Tong Ching-yee, wife of former chief executive Leung Chun-ying, said about 400 affected residents remained there. She said they were welcome to stay longer and that support facilities would be improved.\n",

            "description": "Alibaba Group Holding plans to launch new smart glasses powered by its artificial intelligence assistant Qwen at the coming MWC Barcelona trade show.\nOn Saturday, a company representative confirmed the launch, adding that both online and offline presales would start on Monday, the first day of the annual trade show, formerly known as Mobile World Congress.\nMeanwhile, the company, which owns the South China Morning Post, is preparing a diverse product line-up this year for the global market, including AI rings and AI earphones, according to a person close to the company.\nThe coming release of the Qwen glasses marks Alibaba’s second major foray into smart eyewear. It follows the Quark AI Glasses, priced from 1,899 yuan (US$277), that were officially launched in November 2025, available in the mainland Chinese market.\nThe gadgets target a fast-growing sector. In the first half of 2025, global shipments of smart glasses more than doubled, driven mostly by strong demand for Meta Platform’s glasses, along with new offerings from Xiaomi, according to market research firm Counterpoint.\n\nThe new Alibaba glasses are expected to present a renewed challenge to Meta’s smart eyewear, Ray-Ban Meta, as well as similar wearable devices from Xiaomi and Baidu.\nLast June, Xiaomi launched its own smart glasses priced at 1,999 yuan, while Baidu’s Xiaodu AI Glasses Pro went on sale in November, priced at 2,299 yuan.\nAlibaba has been heavily promoting the Qwen app, which now integrates with its Taobao marketplace, Amap mapping service and travel booking site Fliggy. During the Chinese New Year holiday, it distributed 3 billion yuan worth of incentives to promote Qwen, which resulted in nearly 200 million orders placed during the period.\nChinese tech giants Tencent Holdings and ByteDance also splashed out incentives to attract users to their flagship AI apps ahead of the festival.\nTencent said daily and monthly active users on its Yuanbao AI assistant app exceeded 50 million and 114 million, respectively, after the social media and video gaming giant gave away 1 billion yuan in digital red packets.\nByteDance’s Doubao chatbot, which featured prominently during the widely watched Spring Festival Gala on February 16, recorded 1.9 billion interactions that day.\nAdditional reporting by Ann Cao\n",

            "description": "Nearly 670 Hongkongers have been granted settlement in the United Kingdom under its bespoke BN(O) visa pathway, although the total number of applicants has fallen short of the British government’s lowest “core” estimate five years after its launch.\nWhile tens of thousands of Hongkongers are set to qualify for Indefinite Leave to Remain, or settled status, this year, experts suggested that uncertainties over the UK’s long-term settlement of migrants could deter future applications.\nThe UK introduced the pathway for relevant passport holders in January 2021 in response to the Beijing-imposed national security law.\nWhile the UK announced it would double the permanent settlement qualifying period for migrants to 10 years, Hongkongers on the BN(O) route remain able to qualify for Indefinite Leave to Remain after just five years, followed by citizenship after another year.\nAccording to figures released last week by the Home Office, Britain’s interior ministry, nearly 670 Hongkongers had been granted settlement under the British National (Overseas) route as of the end of 2025.\nIt noted that some individuals may have qualified earlier as time spent on other migration routes counted towards the five-year residence period.\nAccording to the statistics, about 46,900 Hongkongers arrived in the UK under the scheme in its first year of implementation, and thus will soon be able to apply for permanent settlement.\nThe latest figures also show that UK authorities received 191,665 out-of-country BN(O) visa applications between 2021 and 2025, with about 172,000 successful applicants having arrived in the country.\nThe Home Office also recorded about 50,000 in-country extensions over the same period.\nBut those figures fall short of the lowest “core” estimate the Home Office formulated in 2020, ahead of the scheme’s launch, when it compiled an impact assessment related to the estimated social and economic costs of the programme between 2021 and 2025.\nIn the document, the Home Office assessed the cost based on what it called two “core scenarios”, with one estimating 258,000 applications and the other 322,400.\nHeather Rolfe, a senior research fellow with the London-based think tank British Future, said the shortfall was likely due to the previous Conservative government overestimating expected applicants out of “political caution”.\nPrevious UK governments had “significantly underestimated” the interest in other migration schemes, she said.\n“Given that migration is a highly salient and contentious issue in the UK, they would have wanted to avoid that kind of controversy,” she said.\nOther factors affecting interest included that Hongkongers were given other options to resettle, such as in Canada, as well as the costs associated with the visa itself, Rolfe noted.\nShe also expected more applicants to apply for the scheme following a relaxation that was announced earlier this month in light of the sentencing of former media boss Jimmy Lai Chee-ying in his landmark national security trial.\nIn response to Lai’s 20-year term, the Home Office announced that it would expand the scheme to include Hongkongers who were minors at the time of the 1997 handover to China and whose parents had not applied for a BN(O) passport beforehand.\nThe Home Office said it expected 26,000 arrivals under the expanded scheme over the next five years.\nBut Rolfe said “current uncertainty” over the long-term settlement of migrants in the UK could deter further applications in the short term, pointing to an overhaul of the migration model proposed in November.\n\n\nWhile Hongkongers under the BN(O) scheme expressed relief about the unchanged five-year qualifying period, they were plunged back into anxiety after discovering they would be subject to tighter English-language requirements.\nAn income threshold requiring applicants to show earnings of at least £12,570 (US$16,940) for three to five years was also being considered.\nUK Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood previously indicated that any changes were expected to begin to take effect as early as April.\nIn a letter dated February 13, a day after the consultation ended, UK Migration Minister Mike Tapp said the government understood how important the issues were to the Hong Kong community and that it was now “carefully reviewing” the submissions it had received.\n“This analysis will help inform the development of the final earned settlement model, including consideration of any potential exemptions or transitional measures,” he said.\nBrandon To, a Hongkonger who settled in the town of Harrow under the BN(O) scheme, shared the minister’s letter on X, writing: “We are delighted to hear that the government is finally considering ‘transitional measures’.\n“We look forward to more concrete promises from the government to protect Hongkongers’ rights in the UK.”\n",

            "description": "New World Development posted a net loss of HK$3.73 billion (US$477 million) for the first half of fiscal 2026, as asset write-downs continued to weigh on earnings despite improving Hong Kong home sales and ongoing deleveraging efforts.\nThe loss narrowed 44 per cent year on year for the six months ended December 31, as impairments on investment properties eased and financing and tax expenses related to mainland projects declined, according to a Hong Kong stock exchange filing on Friday. No interim dividend was declared.\n“Our team has worked very hard during this period, leading to ongoing improvements in our operations,” said CEO Echo Huang during the earnings call on Friday.\nHuang said the red ink was mainly attributable to non-cash provisions, including impairments on properties under development and completed units held for sale. She stressed that underlying operations had improved and that “we have achieved good results in improving revenue and reducing costs.”\n\nRevenue fell 50 per cent to HK$8.39 billion, dragged down by weaker construction income and fewer property handovers in mainland China.\n“In 2025, we capitalised on the recovery in Hong Kong’s real estate market to seize new opportunities,” Huang said in the filing. “In a volatile market, our focus is not only on growing our business, but also on the continuous optimisation of our financial structure.”\nDeleveraging remains central to the group’s strategy.\nTotal debt declined by HK$1.7 billion to HK$144.3 billion. However, net debt rose HK$2.6 billion to HK$122.7 billion, with the gearing ratio increasing to 59.7 per cent from 58.1 per cent a year earlier.\nChief financial officer Edward Lau attributed the rise to the accounting treatment of Hong Kong joint ventures, as well as repayments of construction loans tied to those projects.\nManagement has stepped up liquidity measures, including bank refinancing and residential asset sales, raising more than HK$34.8 billion from property disposals since early 2025.\n“When cash flow is stable, we will continue to reduce debt – that’s our topmost goal,” Lau said, adding there were currently no further debt exchange plans.\nAddressing market speculation, Huang said the company had no plans for share placements or rights issues.\nShe added that the group’s seven debt-reduction initiatives were “working”, supported by improving contracted sales and a steady recovery in leasing across its mall and office portfolio. Since early 2025, NWD has raised more than HK$34.8 billion through property disposals and sales.\nHong Kong contracted sales reached HK$10.3 billion in the first half, the highest level since 2021, with the Deep Water Pavilia project 93 per cent sold. More than 1,300 units are scheduled for launch in the second half.\nShares of NWD closed 3.6 per cent higher to HK$10.86 on Friday ahead of the earnings announcement. The stock has gained 49.4 per cent so far this year, as Hong Kong’s housing market shows signs of stabilising.\nHowever, Morgan Stanley gave the embattled developer a “reduce” rating with a target price of HK$6.50, according to a report earlier this month.\nThe results come as its parent, Chow Tai Fook Enterprises, faces continued investor scrutiny over its capital allocation and restructuring strategy amid market speculation about potential external investment.\nHong Kong’s property sector remains under pressure from elevated borrowing costs and cautious buyer sentiment, although recent mortgage easing has supported transaction volumes.\nNWD plans to launch about 1,300 units in the next six months, including the low-density luxury project Pavilia Rosa on Rose Street in Kowloon, Grand Austin Bohemian in Tsim Sha Tsui, and Phase 3 of The Pavilia Farm in Tai Wai, which will provide 540 units.\n“Many prospective buyers are shifting their stock market profit into the real estate market,” Huang said.\n",

            "description": "A subsidiary of Hong Kong conglomerate CK Hutchison Holdings has accused Panamanian authorities of undermining due process by making an “unnotified intrusion” at a facility storing materials related to ongoing legal proceedings.\nThe Panama Ports Company (PPC) on Friday accused the country’s government of creating a crisis, calling the “illegal takeover” of two port facilities at the Panama Canal a failure to comply with “constitutional, contractual and international obligations”.\nThe former operator of the Balboa and Cristobal ports issued a statement a day after Panamanian media reported that local authorities had searched one of the company’s offices. Boxes of documents were seen being taken away during the raid.\nIn a ruling last month, the Panamanian Supreme Court declared that a law approving the ports concession held by PPC was unconstitutional.\nPPC said on Friday that the company and its investors had strongly emphasised to the Panamanian government their objection to the “illegal takeover” of the ports and the “occupation” of its property, which included seizing “proprietary and legally protected information”.\n“PPC also specifically requested the state to establish clear coordination mechanisms regarding access to, custody and protection of its proprietary and privileged information as a private company, including information that is not relevant to the operation of the port operations,” it added.\n“Rather than any form of clarification or coordination of protection mechanisms, the state took even more extreme steps to take the property of PPC [on Thursday] through an unnotified intrusion on a private storage facility with proprietary and material subject to legal privilege compiled in the context of ongoing legal proceedings, demonstrating that the state has undermined due process as part of its takeover.”\n\nThe company also slammed Panamanian authorities for multiple actions that it argued showed a failure to comply with its “constitutional, contractual, and international obligations, including in relation to the protection of investments, due process and legal security”.\nSuch actions included orders by the Panamanian government to stop the operation of terminals at the two ports on Monday, as well as the “intrusive invasion” of PPC facilities, it said.\n“PPC and its investors expressly and continuously reserve all applicable rights related to this crisis generated by the Panamanian state,” the company said.\n\n\n\n\nPanama’s takeover caps a year-long dispute over control of the two ports on the key shipping route, which has become a flashpoint in the geostrategic rivalry between Washington and Beijing.\nUnited States President Donald Trump earlier vowed to “take back” the canal from what he claimed was Chinese control.\nThe dispute also intersected with a separate attempt by CK Hutchison to sell more than 40 ports worldwide in a deal with a consortium led by US asset management giant BlackRock and shipping group MSC.\nThe deal drew Beijing’s ire, and Chinese regulators subsequently launched a comprehensive antitrust review in late March 2025, effectively halting the sale.\nReports also indicated that Beijing sought a greater role for state-owned shipping giant Cosco in any arrangement involving the Panama terminals.\n",

            "title": "Scam-hit Cambodia tries to woo Hong Kong but travel agencies have doubts",
            "description": "The head of Cambodia’s tourism body is looking to build partnerships with Hong Kong travel agencies as part of a drive to get visitors returning to his country, which has been plagued by safety concerns in recent years.\nCambodia Tourism Board CEO Kim Minea also told the South China Morning Post that the government was “determined” to eliminate the notorious scam compounds that had trapped thousands of people, including Hongkongers, in recent years.\nBut Hong Kong tour operators said safety was still a major concern among residents and it would be difficult to draw them back to the Southeast Asian nation in the short term.\nCambodia, famous for the Angkor Wat temple complex, is heavily reliant on tourism, with the sector making up 9.4 per cent of gross domestic product (GDP) in 2024.\nBut tourism statistics showed arrivals to the kingdom were down by about 31.4 per cent in the third quarter of 2025, compared with a year earlier, coinciding with a border conflict that erupted with neighbouring Thailand last summer.\nHongkongers have avoided Cambodia in recent years following cases of residents becoming trapped in notorious scam centres operated by crime syndicates across the region.\nCambodia’s Ministry of Tourism recorded only 62 arrivals from Hong Kong between January and September last year, while about 889,000 visitors were listed as coming from China. In 2017, by comparison, more than 13,000 Hong Kong residents were counted as having visited.\n\n\nSpeaking to the SCMP on Friday during a visit to Hong Kong, Kim acknowledged that addressing visitors’ safety concerns was a priority.\nHe suggested that the border conflict with Thailand had largely settled since a ceasefire came into effect in December, and that the country’s tourist areas had not been affected by the dispute.\nHe also said that the government was committed to eliminating scam compounds.\nThe government was currently considering a law that would provide a clearer legal framework to clamp down on the illegal activity, while regional authorities had until the end of March to shut down any suspected scam centres in their jurisdictions, he said.\n“From the government, we see a determination to eliminate this [scam compound activity] and prevent it from happening again,” he said. “We have to chase them out of our country but we also have to make sure they won’t come back again.”\nKim said there was also a “huge gap” between the reality on the ground in Cambodia and the impression people got from the news, which his team hoped to address by inviting tour operators to visit the country.\nHis team has a goal of bringing about 500 travel agents from around the world to visit the country this year, roughly 20 per cent of whom are expected to come from China, including Hong Kong and Macau.\nHe said travellers from Hong Kong and other parts of China would be able to visit the country visa-free as part of a pilot scheme running from June to October.\nKim said he believed that Hongkongers would be particularly attracted to the country’s cultural products, food and cheaper luxury goods.\n“So now our team is starting to build relationships with the tourism sector in Hong Kong,” he said.\n“First … to provide an update about Cambodia, particularly [so] that they have more confidence in us in the future. In the future it will be a safe destination.”\nLocal tour operators said there was still a long way to go before Hongkongers would flock back to the country.\nYuen Chun-ning, CEO of the WWPKG travel agency, said safety was still a major concern among Hongkongers and that he did not believe many would consider travelling there in the near future.\nHe said this was especially true as the Japanese yen was still quite weak while tourism was also opening up within the Greater Bay Area – the cluster of cities in southern China, including Hong Kong, that Beijing hopes to develop into an economic powerhouse.\nFrederick Yip, executive director of Goldjoy Travel, said his agency hosted regular tours to Cambodia about 10 years ago, but it was now “very hard” to convince Hongkongers to travel there because of the scam centre issue.\nHongkongers looking to travel to the region had opted for neighbouring countries such as Vietnam instead, he said.\n“Not that Hongkongers aren’t thinking about going [to Cambodia], but it will take time to resume to previous levels,” he said.\n",

            "description": "The average number of aspiring Hong Kong taxi drivers taking a crucial industry test each month has increased by nearly 30 per cent following the launch of a simplified version of the assessment last year, the transport minister has said.\nSecretary for Transport and Logistics Mable Chan also said on Saturday that the government was increasing the number of dedicated meeting spaces for the city’s five premium taxi fleets at cultural and business landmarks.\n“We streamlined the written test arrangements for taxi drivers last year. The average monthly number of candidates has now risen to around 1,800, representing an increase of nearly 30 per cent compared with previous figures,” she said in a social media post.\n“This continues to inject fresh impetus into the industry, attracting more new entrants. Looking ahead to the new year, we will persist in advancing the pace of reform within the taxi sector.”\nChan earlier said the new test had simplified and reduced questions about locations and routes due to the availability of navigation technology that could assist drivers in quickly finding destinations and planning more efficient routes.\nThe transport chief also said on Saturday that more dedicated spots for app-using passengers of premium fleet taxis to meet would be provided outside the Palace Museum, the M+ museum, the Hong Kong Convention and Exhibition Centre and the airport.\nThe five premium fleets started operating their first batch of taxis last year.\nOn Saturday, Chan also reminded drivers that they would need to start providing at least two electronic payment options from April 1. They should include one method that involved a QR code, such as FPS, and one without, such as credit cards, she said.\nWhile the number of test-takers has increased, the premium fleets struggled last year to meet a government recruitment target.\nThe fleets were estimated to be operating around 1,300 taxis by December, well below the government’s target of 3,500.\nAs of the end of October, about 210,000 people held a taxi driving licence, but only around 46,000 were active.\nThere were around 18,200 taxi driving licence holders aged 40 or below as of last August, representing an increase of more than 50 per cent compared with 2019.\n",

            "title": "Cruise ship calls in Hong Kong may top 200 this year, tourism minister says",
            "description": "Cruise ship calls in Hong Kong may exceed 200 this year, the city’s tourism minister has said, as she revealed that authorities will consider measures to create synergy between the terminal and an emerging cultural hub in Kai Tak.\nSecretary for Culture, Sports and Tourism Rosanna Law Shuk-pui on Saturday also said cruise ships made 189 port calls in 2025, representing 88 per cent of peak levels, and Chinese vessels might stop in the city this year, which she described as “refreshing news”.\n“It’s been three years since the resumption of travel after Covid, and there is a lag in sailing schedules as they run on a three-year cycle, so I believe we could see cruises that haven’t docked in Hong Kong recently returning or new ones coming here,” she said.\n“We could see more than 200 cruise ships calling in Hong Kong this year.”\n\nWith the Kai Tak Cruise Terminal undergoing an operator tendering exercise, Law suggested the port could explore opportunities to collaborate with the adjacent Runway 1331, a Covid-19 isolation facility-turned-youth hostel and cultural hub.\n“I am aware that Runway 1331 will now operate in synergy with the Kai Tak Sports Park. Could we add the cruise terminal to the mix … whether it’s for food and beverage, youth activities or cultural spaces? … We will announce details when they’re available,” she said.\nVisits by Chinese cruise ships to Hong Kong would “definitely” improve collaboration with the Greater Bay Area, Law said, adding the high-speed railway could also bring passengers from mainland China to Hong Kong.\nThe tender for operating the terminal from June 1, 2028, for a decade was open to interested parties globally and should be concluded this year under the supervision of the Tourism Commission, the minister added.\nLaw stressed that while the current operator, Worldwide Cruise Terminals, had attracted mixed comments over its performance in the past, it had been successful in bringing ships to Hong Kong, barring the interruptions of the Covid years.\nShe noted the terminal could simultaneously accommodate two cruise ships carrying up to 6,000 passengers each, a vessel capacity among the largest in the world.\nTimothy Chui Ting-pong, executive director of the Hong Kong Tourism Association, said the Runway 1331 area could focus further on its role as a youth cultural hub, which would also increase its allure as a tourist attraction.\n“Cruise passengers could have a look at the area before they board and depart. There is no need for another large shopping centre in the neighbourhood, as there are already plenty in Kai Tak,” Chui said.\nHe noted that Runway 1331 intended to become a place where young people could take advantage of opportunities for entrepreneurship, cultural exchanges and talent development, with hostel room leases ranging from days to months.\nThe facility includes amenities such as a performance venue, basketball courts, a waterfront promenade and common spaces, with Chui adding its synergy with the terminal would also hinge on the new operator’s plans.\n",

            "title": "No repeat of Exchange Fund transfer planned in next 5 years, Paul Chan says",
            "description": "Hong Kong does not plan to make another transfer from its Exchange Fund in the next five years, the finance chief has said, citing a new medium-range forecast that explains why the rare move will not be repeated.\nFinancial Secretary Paul Chan Mo-po elaborated on his plan on Saturday, after his budget announcement that he would withdraw HK$150 billion (US$19.2 billion) from the government’s main investment arm and de facto sovereign wealth fund sparked concerns about the city’s financial stability.\n“In the entire medium-range forecast, apart from the HK$150 billion transfer over the two years just mentioned, there are actually no other transfers projected,” Chan told a radio programme. “I will not make this a normal practice.”\nHis assurances follow Wednesday’s budget announcement that the government would withdraw HK$75 billion annually for two years from the Exchange Fund’s investment income to top up the Capital Works Reserve Fund.\nThe move, justified by the Exchange Fund’s record-high investment income of HK$330 billion last year, aims to support the Northern Metropolis and other infrastructure projects.\nChan argued that with the fund’s total assets exceeding HK$4.1 trillion, the transfer represented only about half of last year’s investment gains and would not undermine the city’s financial stability or its ability to defend the currency peg.\n“We took into account the large size of the Exchange Fund,” he said, emphasising that the funds were being reallocated from financial investments to infrastructure projects that would eventually generate tax and economic returns.\n\n\nBut the unprecedented move has raised eyebrows among financial conservatives. Experts have cautioned that making such withdrawals a regular practice could undermine the city’s long-held reputation for financial prudence.\nAddressing the financing of the Northern Metropolis, Chan disclosed a shift in the government’s bond issuance strategy.\nWhile the administration had traditionally favoured short-term debt to take advantage of lower interest rates, it would now increase the proportion of longer-term bonds, he said.\nHe also said that going forward, the government would explore issuing a greater proportion of long-term bonds to better align cash flow with infrastructure investments in the megaproject.\nHe noted that infrastructure projects had long gestation periods before generating revenue, making long-term debt a more prudent way to align assets and liabilities.\nThe government forecast its level of debt-to-gross domestic product would rise from the current 14.4 per cent to about 19.9 per cent over the next five years, a level Chan insisted remained “relatively low” by international standards.\nChan also outlined a more hands-on government role in driving private sector development within the metropolis.\nMoving beyond the traditional “highest bidder wins” land sale model, authorities would actively partner with private developers holding land banks and with technology enterprises seeking to establish footholds in the city, he said.\n“We encourage developers who have land to come to the government if they have looked for tech enterprises or advanced manufacturing firms,” Chan said.\nHe added that the government was prepared to facilitate land tenders or even co-invest in projects to speed up development.\n\nThe approach marks a significant departure from the government’s traditional laissez-faire stance towards land development. It is also considered a signal of a more interventionist industrial policy as the city strives to catch up in terms of innovation.\nDonald Low, professor of practice in public policy at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, said that while tapping financial reserves to fund infrastructure projects was a common and cost-effective strategy globally, it carried the risk of eroding financial discipline by bypassing market scrutiny.\n“Unlike borrowing from the market, drawing from reserves doesn’t naturally impose any discipline on the government,” he said.\n“With borrowing, the market serves as a disciplining mechanism. With drawing from reserves, there’s no disciplining mechanism other than the government itself.”\nLow also expressed concerns about the government’s future financial discipline.\n“The main concern with these drawdowns is that, over time, the government may become less disciplined and more reliant on its reserves as a cheap source of financing,” he added.\n“Who decides whether the project that is to be financed from reserves is something that generates a positive return over the long term?”\nLow argued that Chan’s personal assurances were insufficient without institutional safeguards, noting Hong Kong lacked the formal constraints of other jurisdictions that prevented excessive drawdowns by future administrations.\n“There’s no formal rule that limits or constrains how much the government of the day can draw from reserves accumulated over many years,” he said.\n“Singapore, for instance, has a ‘two-key’ rule that requires the government to obtain both parliamentary and presidential approvals for any drawdown from past reserves.”\n",

            "title": "Commercial EV use needs boost after car owner tax break ends, green groups say",
            "description": "Hong Kong environmental groups have urged the government to focus on accelerating the commercial use of electric vehicles and enhancing green infrastructure, after scrapping a tax concession scheme for private cars that has cost HK$30 billion over the past decade.\nGreen groups said on Friday that they supported the government’s decision to end the first registration tax (FRT) concessions for private electric cars, including the “One-for-One Replacement Scheme”. The move was announced by Financial Secretary Paul Chan Mo-po in his budget address on Wednesday.\nThe scheme offers car owners a higher FRT concession of up to HK$172,500 (US$22,056) when they scrap and deregister an eligible older private car in exchange for a new electric vehicle (EV) purchase.\nChan said in his address that about 70 per cent of newly registered cars in Hong Kong were EVs and the need for the concession no longer existed.\n“From a modest variety of electric vehicles with higher prices to a larger variety of models with heightened comfort and better features, and a steady drop in prices, we believe electric cars have become competitive enough,” he said.\nIn response to queries from the South China Morning Post, the Transport Department revealed that more than 128,000 vehicles had received the tax incentives since 2018.\n\nAs of the end of December 2025, Hong Kong had about 149,000 EVs, or about 16.3 per cent of the total number of vehicles in the city, the department said.\nFigures from the Environment and Ecology Bureau this month showed that the government had waived more than HK$30 billion over the past decade through first registration tax concessions, including the one-for-one scheme.\nAround 140,000 of the EVs were private, with the growth in recent years attributed to significant improvements in factors such as price, charging infrastructure, models and performance, the bureau said.\nThe bureau projected that the number of private EVs could exceed 290,000 by 2030.\n\n\n\n\nIn comparison, the waiver scheme for commercial vehicles, which ends in March 2028, has only accumulated HK$100 million over the past decade.\nLast year, the penetration rate for electric commercial vehicles was only around 19 per cent, compared with 70 per cent for private vehicles.\nCurrently, just 0.5 per cent of the 18,000 licensed taxis are electric while only 1.4 per cent of the more than 6,000 buses owned by four operators were e-buses as of October 2024.\nSteven Chan Wing-kit, assistant environmental affairs manager at The Green Earth, said it was a “pity” that the government decided to end the scheme, although he agreed that the market for private EVs was now much more mature.\nHe noted that the penetration rate of commercial EVs was still very low and suggested that the government could pivot its efforts to help businesses transition.\n“If we want to continue promoting electric vehicles, we should focus subsidies on commercial vehicles, as the penetration rate of electric commercial vehicles is far lower than that of private cars,” Chan said.\n“Since commercial vehicles travel much longer distances, electrification would further reduce roadside air pollution.”\n\nThink tank Civic Exchange said it welcomed the decision to stop extending the FRT concession for private EVs.\nExecutive director Lawrence Iu said that although the scheme had encouraged car owners to switch to EVs, the number of private vehicles on the road had ultimately increased by more than 2 per cent from 565,213 in 2018 to 578,001 in 2024.\nHe said that promoting the use of EVs for commercial purposes would be a crucial move in reducing carbon emissions.\n“Challenges faced by commercial electric vehicles include the limited availability of charging infrastructure and the high cost of electric vehicles,” he said.\n“But the government is taking steps to address these challenges, such as investing in green corridors and promoting the use of electric vehicles for commercial purposes.”\nPointing to the United Kingdom as an example, Iu said the government could tax EV users through modest mileage-based charging to provide a fair road-use contribution framework while maintaining clean mobility incentives.\nJeffrey Hung Oi-shing, chief policy research officer at Friends of the Earth, said that to achieve Hong Kong’s goal of carbon neutrality by 2050, more resources should be allocated to commercial vehicles and public transport.\n“Commercial vehicles play a significant role in pollution and roadside carbon emissions,” he said.\n“The focus should be on improving the infrastructure, such as charging facilities, to support the growth of electric commercial vehicles.”\nHung also urged the government to cooperate with mainland China to introduce more electric commercial vehicles to the Hong Kong market.\nIu noted that the government had been stepping up efforts to support taxi and public transport operators to switch to electric alternatives.\n“Ultimately, they should encourage more people to switch to public transport,” he said.\nHung suggested that the government improve planning in new town developments and invest in greener transport infrastructure.\n“Better road connectivity, bike lanes and pedestrian-friendly infrastructure would encourage the use of environmentally friendly modes of transport for their last-mile commute, like many other international cities in the world,” he said.\n",

TREATS is among the beneficiaries of Operation Santa Claus (OSC), an annual fundraising campaign jointly organised by the South China Morning Post and RTHK.\nAmy Wu, director of corporate communications at Chinachem Group, said the session reflected the company’s commitment to giving back to the community.\n\n“At Chinachem Group, we create people‑centred places that connect people with their surroundings, and foster belonging, inclusion and shared purpose,” she said. “This closely aligns with the OSC theme of building bridges.\nThe workshop is part of Chinachem Group’s ongoing support for the annual fundraiser. Since 2021, the Group has helped the campaign bring businesses and communities together, turning goodwill into tangible action.\nThrough the initiative, staff volunteers have partnered with NGOs and beneficiaries to reach people who might otherwise receive less support, helping to strengthen social ties across Hong Kong.\n\nHands-on activities like the mochi-making workshop hold special meaning for the group.\n“They bring corporate volunteers and children with educational needs together in a joyful, structured setting, fostering empathy, confidence and communication skills on both sides,” Wu said.\n“It helps break down social barriers, and this is the kind of volunteering that reflects our values of Care, Contribute and Grow.”\nWu said the group extends this spirit of care to people with diverse needs by supporting dance sessions for individuals living with Parkinson’s, football training for children with autism and ballet classes for young people from underprivileged backgrounds.\n\nAt the same time, the group continued to invest deeply in its neighbouring communities of Tsuen Wan and Kwai Tsing, aiming to strengthen long-term connections and create meaningful, place-based impact, she added.\nChinachem Group collaborates with partner organisations to conduct regular home visits to elderly residents living alone or in pairs in Tsuen Wan and Kwai Tsing. It also activates its own spaces, such as shopping centres, as community hubs and gathering points for public use.\nWu also said that family sports sessions, such as pickleball classes and group walks or runs along nearby trails and the waterfront, were also organised to encourage people of all ages to stay active and connect with their surroundings.\n\nWu described these efforts as placemaking, creating neighbourhoods where people feel connected, supported and proud to belong.\n“In Tsuen Wan, we focus on understanding local needs and co‑designing programmes with community partners to ensure our initiatives remain relevant as demographics and neighbourhood dynamics evolve,” she said.\n“All these steps support our aim of creating ‘Places With Heart’, places where people of all ages and backgrounds can connect and truly feel part of the community.”\nOSC has raised around HK$396 million (US$50.6 million) for more than 365 charitable projects and helped more than 100,000 people since it was officially launched by the SCMP and RTHK in 1988.\nFind out more about OSC here.\n",
