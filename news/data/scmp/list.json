            "description": "Tesla will make a return to the world’s largest import trade fair in Shanghai next week, after skipping two major events in China’s commercial hub over the past two years.\\nThe US electric vehicle (EV) maker will showcase its Cybercab robotaxi at the China International Import Expo (CIIE), marking the Asia-Pacific debut of its driverless model.\\n“The trade fair will help Tesla show how it is actively integrating artificial intelligence into the real world,” the company said in a statement. “We are redefining the labour, transportation, and new energy industries.”\\nTesla’s comeback to the CIIE comes as its mainland sales fell 6 per cent year on year in the first nine months of 2025, underscoring intensifying competition from local rivals.\\nMainland China – the world’s largest automotive and EV market – remains Tesla’s second-largest market after the US.\\nIts Shanghai Gigafactory, the company’s biggest production hub globally, delivered 432,704 Model 3 and Model Y vehicles to mainland customers between January and September, representing 4.9 per cent of the country’s total EV deliveries during that period.\\nTesla once commanded a 16 per cent share of China’s EV market when it began local production in 2020, but its share slid to 6.9 per cent last year amid an intensifying price war and the rise of domestic brands.\\nThe company unveiled its Cybercab in the US last year. CEO Elon Musk said then that Tesla aimed to produce more than 2 million units annually, with mass production expected to start next year.\\nTesla was absent from last year’s CIIE and from the Shanghai Auto Show in April, without offering an explanation.\\n\\nLaunched in 2018, the CIIE serves as a platform for China to demonstrate its commitment to free trade and greater market access. It is also regarded by many foreign firms as a key marketing opportunity, as Beijing encourages local companies to buy imported goods.\\nIn 2024, purchase agreements worth US$80 billion were signed during the six-day event, up 2 per cent from the previous year.\\nThis year’s fair will begin on Wednesday, featuring participation from international carmakers including General Motors, Volkswagen and BMW, according to the organisers.\\nSeparately, the Shanghai Auto Show, held every two years, drew more than 70 carmakers from 26 countries and regions this year, with over 100 new models launched, according to the Shanghai Council for the Promotion of International Trade.\\nChina could see as many as 300,000 driverless taxis operating in its four top-tier cities by 2030, supported by rapid advances in AI and the fiercely competitive EV sector, according to UBS.\\nThat number could climb to 4 million by the late 2030s, as more passengers embraced autonomous transport, said Paul Gong, head of China automotive research at UBS.\\n",

            "title": "ONE Championship: Christian Lee vows to finish off Alibeg Rasulov in Tokyo rematch",
            "description": "Christian Lee is returning to Tokyo for ONE 173 with a clear mission: the reigning ONE Championship lightweight and welterweight MMA king wants to erase the memory of his accidental eye poke that halted his first bout with Alibeg Rasulov and prove once again he is one of the greatest finishers in the promotion’s history.\\nThe 27-year-old has spent two years on the sidelines since becoming a two-division world champion. Now back to defend his lightweight crown against the undefeated Russian contender, Lee is fuelled by legacy and family pride as he prepares to compete in Japan once more.\\n“I’m excited to be going back to Tokyo,” the Canadian-born American told the Post. “The crowd is great and the fans are amazing. Most importantly, I’m just excited to get back in there and finish what I started in this rematch.”\\nThe first fight between Lee and Rasulov in Bangkok last December ended abruptly in round two because of the foul, leaving the lightweight title picture unresolved. Lee insists he was building momentum when the incident took place and expects no slow start this time around.\\n“In our first fight, I felt like the momentum was starting to shift my way,” he said. “One more round and I feel like I could have gotten him out of there. Going into this fight, I’ll be looking to pick up right where I left off.\\n“There’ll be no need for a feeling-out process.”\\n\\nEye pokes have become a hot topic in mixed martial arts, especially after the UFC heavyweight title fight at UFC 321 ended in a “no contest” after champion Tom Aspinall got eye poked by challenger Ciryl Gane. Lee understands the debate first-hand, but stresses that most fouls are accidental.\\n“It’s a fight. You never know what’s going to happen in there,” he said. “I don’t feel there are many guys who intentionally poke the eye. You’re thinking about landing strikes, defence, grappling. In my fight, I had no idea until they replayed it. You have to look at situations case by case.”\\nFor a fighter with Lee’s all-action style, the solution is not obvious. He recognised the need for fairness while acknowledging the chaos of real combat.\\n“It’s hard to say what should be done. You don’t want to let people get away with it if it’s intentional, but when two guys are in there fighting, you can’t control every moment.”\\n\\n\\nLee has built his reputation on finishing opponents with ruthless efficiency. He became the youngest-ever male MMA world champion in ONE history when he knocked out Shinya Aoki in 2019, then added the welterweight belt with a dramatic comeback stoppage of Kiamrian Abbasov in 2022.\\nAsked how he saw the rematch ending, his answer was direct.\\n“I think I’m going to take him down and submit him. First round,” he said. “Nice fun way would be to take him down, submit him, get my pay cheque.”\\nFatherhood had added new motivation to his career after time away from the cage. He said supporting his family had sharpened his focus.\\n“Becoming a dad has made me a stronger fighter,” he said. “It’s so rewarding to fight, provide for my family, and do what I love.”\\n\\nThe Lee family name carries elite standards in the sport. Christian’s sister Angela retired in 2023 after a historic run as atomweight world champion, while brother Adrian is a rising teenage prodigy. Adrian suffered the first loss of his young career this year, a moment Christian believed would fuel his growth.\\n“These lessons really propel you to make changes and become better,” he said. “It’s only a matter of time before he fights for a title.”\\nFor now, Christian’s focus was solely on Rasulov and a dominant return in a country steeped in martial arts history.\\n“To defend my belt in Japan feels like a big event and a historic one,” he said. “I’m excited to be back in there.”\\nNo special walkout. No fanfare. Just business.\\n“I plan on going out there, walking forward and getting my hand raised,” he said.\\n",

            "description": "A Malaysian court on Friday sentenced a woman to five years&apos; jail for neglect leading to the death of her six-year-old autistic son, in a case that has shocked the nation and raised questions about the lack of support for families with special needs children.\\nThe body of Zayn Rayyan Abdul Matin was found in a stream near his home in a suburb outside Kuala Lumpur on December 6, 2023, a day after he was reported missing by his parents.\\nAuthorities have speculated that Zayn could have been murdered after an autopsy revealed injuries to his neck and body, which police said were signs of self-defence. Investigators are still investigating the circumstances of his death.\\nOn Friday, Sessions Court Judge Syahliza Warnoh said Zayn’s mother, Ismanira Abdul Manaf, had failed to disprove the prosecution’s case that her negligence had led to physical injury to her son, according to a report by national newswire Bernama.\\nThe crime carries a maximum fine of 50,000 ringgit (US$11,800), up to 20 years&apos; jail or both.\\nIsmanira, 30, was instructed to begin her sentence on Friday.\\n\\n\\nHer case centred on witness accounts that she had let her son roam around their housing block unsupervised on the day that he went missing.\\nPolice also secured transcripts of WhatsApp messages shared between Ismarina and her husband, Zaim Ikhwan Zahari, which included lines of her saying she was “so stressed I could die” and that she had “spanked his bottom” when she was annoyed and angry with Zayn’s behaviour.\\nZaim, also 30, was acquitted of a similar charge in July.\\nThe case has raised widespread concern over the level of support available for families with special needs children, especially when both parents are working, as in the case of Zayn’s family.\\nSocial work experts have called for deeper community involvement to help parents watch out for their special needs children in the aftermath of Zayn’s case, and to shed pervasive social stigmas surrounding mental and physical disabilities.\\nNearly 290,000 students registered in schools across the country were categorised as having either physical or mental disabilities last year, according to government data.\\nOf the figure, over 23,600 were diagnosed with autism, while more than 9,500 suffered from attention deficit hyperactivity disorder.\\n",

            "title": "Canada, Philippines deepen military ties with new joint forces pact amid China concerns",
            "description": "The Philippines and Canada are set to sign a visiting forces agreement, a military cooperation pact that would allow troops from both countries on each other’s soil for joint exercises and other activities amid China’s increasing influence in the region.\\nCanadian Minister of National Defence David McGuinty will be in Manila on Sunday to hold bilateral meetings with Philippine Defence Secretary Gilberto Teodoro Jnr and sign the agreement, according to an advisory released by the Department of National Defence on Wednesday.\\nThe signing of the agreement follows steps by Manila and Ottawa to deepen their security relations since inking a Memorandum of Understanding on Defence Cooperation in January last year.\\nCooperation between both countries “has expanded both in breadth and depth across all areas of defence, especially in maritime security, cybersecurity and capacity building”, according to a statement by the Philippines’ Department of Foreign Affairs in April.\\n\\nAnalysts called the agreement a natural step forward in the deepening security ties between the Philippines and Canada as both countries were concerned about China’s military build-up in the Indo-Pacific region.\\nDon McLain Gill, an international relations lecturer at De La Salle University, told This Week in Asia that the agreement allowed both countries to efficiently deploy troops and circumvent the bureaucratic delays that come with joint military exercises.\\n“The [agreement] would streamline military-to-military cooperation with the Philippines, and this would in fact reiterate and reinforce the 2024 memorandum of understanding,” the geopolitical analyst said.\\nJulio Amador, the interim president of the Foundation for the National Interest and founder and trustee of the non-profit policy advisory firm FACTS Asia, called the agreement the “next step”.\\nIt creates a legal framework for ramping up military-to-military activities – including the annual Balikatan exercises with the US – which will benefit the Philippines’ armed forces and increase operability with Canada’s troops, according to him.\\n“A visiting forces agreement with Canada strengthens the Philippines’ network of partners on defence and military issues, and indicates that diplomatic and military cooperation is increasing and deepening,” he said.\\n\\n\\nAmador added that the agreement added to the Philippines’ potential deterrence strategy and showed that the country was “beginning to move beyond just exposing China’s belligerent behaviour”.\\n“When looking at the strategic environment from the South China Sea to the cross-straits, the [agreement] creates a partnership between the two countries that hints at alignment on how to respond to a China that is becoming more confident in flexing its muscles,” Amador said.\\nAway from Washington’s shadow\\nAnalysts say that the defence pact comes amid a fundamentally changed strategic environment, with the deal providing mutual benefits for both countries – particularly as Canada moves away from the shadow of the US in the region.\\n“When it comes to the security threats that the Philippines is facing, adding more defence partners is a critical component of, hopefully, a bigger strategy than what we are currently seeing right now,” Amador said.\\n“The [agreement} is an indication that the Philippines is actively identifying like-minded partners as it responds to a strategic environment that has fundamentally changed.”\\nMeanwhile, Gill called the Philippines “a natural partner for Canada” and one of the North American country’s anchors in its Indo-Pacific strategy, which it launched in 2022. Ottawa has committed C$2.3 billion (US$1.6 billion) over five years to developing its security engagement in the region.\\n\\nChester Cabalza, founder and president of the think tank International Development Security and Cooperation, said that the “Philippines’ like-minded friends” such as Canada were “all in a hurry to strike a defence deal while the iron is hot”.\\n“Both Ottawa and Manila are enjoying the momentum as Canadians and Filipinos lead the marathon on international rules-based order,” he said.\\nCabalza pointed out that the Philippines has benefited from Canada’s satellite-powered dark vessel detection programme used in the West Philippine Sea, Manila’s exclusive economic zone within the South China Sea, to detect ships from the China Coast Guard and maritime militia that have “gone dark” or turned off their automatic identification system trackers.\\nCanada had “made a name for itself as a trusted, functional security partner of the Philippines”, Gill said.\\n“Our security relationship with Ottawa took off in a relatively short amount of time. Within just two years, we were able to accomplish so much in terms of broadening and deepening our security partnership,” he said, referring to the dark vessel detection programme support and the joint sail activities between both countries.\\nHowever, Gill added that naval exercises should not be the primary cornerstone of the security partnership between both countries, and stressed that other areas should be highlighted and leveraged, such as cyber defence.\\n“Canada has a very robust experience in cyber defence and the cybersecurity threats that the Philippines continues to ... face on a daily basis. Canada is a natural partner in this regard, and I think that we have much to tap and maximise when it comes to our cybersecurity cooperation,” he said.\\n\\nShipbuilding was another strong point for the partnership, Gill said, adding that Canada could play a role in the imparting of technology, technical cooperation, and skills-building as Manila looks to strengthen its shipbuilding capabilities.\\nMeanwhile, Manila can serve as a gateway for Ottawa to further deepen its engagement in the region, with the Philippines seen as “one of the success stories of Canada’s Indo-Pacific strategy”, Gill said.\\n“By improving its security relations to the Philippines, this could eventually be a stepping stone for other countries in the region. We’ve seen Canada and Indonesia sign their first-ever bilateral free trade agreement,” he said.\\n“So we see how Canada has also been perceived more positively in the region, away from the common misconception that Canada is basically just a reflection or shadow of the US strategy in the Indo-Pacific. Canada has clearly shown great agency, and this is something that would benefit its objectives in the region as it seeks to diversify its security and economic partners as well.”\\n",

            "title": "Fate of thousands feared in Sudan’s Darfur after reported rampage by paramilitaries",
            "description": "Sudanese fleeing a paramilitary force that seized a city in the country’s Darfur region trickled into a nearby refugee camp on Thursday after walking for miles, telling aid workers that roads were littered with bodies. Aid groups feared for the fate of thousands more trying to escape, with hundreds reportedly killed in the turmoil.\\nThe UN Security Council convened an emergency meeting on Sudan amid international alarm over the bloodshed. UN officials have warned of a rampage by the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces after it took over the city of El-Fasher, reportedly killing more than 450 people in a hospital and carrying out ethnically targeted killings of civilians and sexual assaults.\\nSpeaking at the meeting, UN humanitarian chief Tom Fletcher criticised the Security Council for not acting sooner in Sudan. The country has been torn for the past two years by a war between the military and the RSF that has killed more than 40,000 people and left more than 14 million displaced.\\n“Can anyone here say we did not know this was coming?” he said. “We cannot hear the screams, but as we sit here today the horror is continuing. Women and girls are being raped, people being mutilated and killed with utter impunity.”\\n\\nAs the US and others at the gathering called for an end to “external support” for the warring parties, Sudan’s representative accused the United Arab Emirates, a top American ally, of backing the RSF. The Gulf nation has denied reports it provides weapons and funding to the paramilitary forces. A UN panel of experts in 2024 said it found the reports credible.\\nThe RSF had been besieging El-Fasher, the last military-held stronghold in the Darfur region, for the past 500 days. Its capture raised fears that Africa’s third-largest nation may split, with the paramilitaries holding Darfur and the military holding the capital Khartoum and the north and east of the country.\\nThe UN migration agency said over 36,000 have reportedly fled El-Fasher since Sunday, with people fleeing on foot in the middle of the night. Experts analysing satellite imagery say an earthen wall built by the RSF around the city was preventing residents from fleeing and has become a “kill box” where some appear to have been shot.\\nOnly thousands have arrived at Tawila, a town some 60km (35 miles) west of El-Fasher. Tawila has already burgeoned into a sprawling refugee camp housing hundreds of thousands who fled the RSF’s siege of El-Fasher over the past year.\\nMathilde Vu, advocacy manager for the Norwegian Refugee Council, which manages the camp, said the small number reaching Tawila “should be a concern for all of us … That tells the horror of the journey”.\\nThe new arrivals told aid workers that there were arbitrary killings by RSF along the roads, which were littered with bodies, the International Rescue Committee said. Save the Children said arriving women described hiding with their children in trenches or abandoned buildings inside El-Fasher to escape fighters, then being attacked and robbed by armed men as they left the city.\\n\\nVu said the vast majority of those arriving in Tawila were women, or families headed by women, as well as large numbers of children separated from their parents. Some among the arrivals were injured, many were malnourished.\\nSome women reported rapes as they fled, Vu said.\\n“Men are just not arriving. Either they were killed, disappeared or lost along the way,” she said.\\nIn Tawila, the newly displaced sheltered under trees. One woman, Aisha Ismael, said she arrived barefoot with none of her belongings amid constant drone attacks and shelling. People foraged for livestock fodder known as ambaz, which is made from peanut shells and water, because they were so hungry.\\n“We looked for it in the dirt to eat and they didn’t even let us. If they catch us, they hit us and throw it away,” she said.\\nDisrupted communications around El-Fasher has made assessing the devastation inside the city difficult. Witnesses told Associated Press that RSF fighters went from house to house, beating and shooting people, including women and children.\\n\\n🚨HUMAN SECURITY EMERGENCY🚨\\nDay 2: RSF continues mass killings in El Fasher: @HRL_YaleSPH finds evidence of mass killings at RSF-controlled former Children’s Hospital, Saudi Hospital and along the berm.#KeepEyesOnSudan\\n🛰️@AirbusSpace @Maxarhttps://t.co/1HApllgNL5 pic.twitter.com/g9KmBLhjH0\\n— Humanitarian Research Lab (HRL) at YSPH (@HRL_YaleSPH) October 29, 2025\\n\\nSome 460 patients and their companions were reportedly killed on Tuesday at the Saudi Hospital in El-Fasher, said Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the director general of the World Health Organization.\\nThe RSF on Thursday denied carrying out killings at the hospital. It said it had arrested a number of individuals accused of committing violations during the seizure of El-Fasher.\\nThe Yale School of Public Health’s Humanitarian Research Lab said satellite imagery from Airbus corroborated alleged killings by the RSF around the Saudi Hospital. It also analysed images of a children’s hospital that the RSF turned into a detention centre months ago and found “a pile consistent with human remains” in the yard.\\n“We think those are people who were killed at the detention centre,” the lab’s executive director Nathaniel Raymond said.\\nThe Yale researchers also said that “systematic killings” took place in the vicinity of the earthen wall, which the RSF built outside the city earlier this year.\\n“The entire city is surrounded by a berm. It is a kill box, to trap them, to kill them,” said Raymond.\\n\\nAt the Security Council gathering, US ambassador to the UN Dorothy Shea condemned “the horrific violence occurring in El-Fasher”. She repeated Washington’s stance that the RSF and its allied militias have committed genocide in Sudan.\\nShe said American officials are working to secure “an immediate humanitarian truce and halting external support” for the violence in Sudan.\\nThe military - which opponents say is linked to Sudanese Islamist groups - and the RSF were previously allies in ruling Sudan, until they fell out in a struggle for power in 2003. Both sides have faced allegations of human rights abuses.\\nBut rights groups and the United Nations have accused the RSF and allied Arab militias of repeated mass killings of civilians and widespread rapes, mainly targeting non-Arab communities. The RSF is largely made up of fighters from the Janjaweed militia that committed genocide in the early 2000s in Darfur.\\nEgypt, where the military dominates the government, gives political backing to the Sudanese military, seeing it as a more reliable ally in the neighbouring nation.\\nThe UAE is reported to back the RSF, similar to its support of armed factions in Libya and Yemen to spread its influence and combat Islamist groups. It has repeatedly denied allegations that it funnels weapons to the RSF. But in January 2024, the UN-appointed Panel of Experts for Sudan detailed reports of cargo planes believed to carry weapons destined for the RSF through neighbouring Chad and called the reports credible.\\nDuring Thursday’s session, the UAE’s representative to the UN, Mohamed Abushahab, said the Gulf state stands in “solidarity” with the Sudanese people and announced US$100 million in humanitarian aid.\\nSudan’s UN ambassador Al-Harith Idriss Al-Harith Mohamed accused the UAE of waging a “war of aggression” in Sudan with its support of the RSF and criticised the Security Council for failing to take “any practical measures to hold this particular sponsor and others accountable”.\\n",

            "title": "ABB’s top industrial chip and robotics expert Pang Zhibo leaves Sweden for China",
            "description": "Pang Zhibo, a leading expert on industrial chips and robots with high-end manufacturing giant ABB in Sweden, has returned to China and joined Peking University as a fully tenured professor.\\nAs ABB’s senior principal scientist, Pang was second only to the company’s chief technology officer – who personally appointed him – and oversaw more than 800 developers and 80 technical products globally across all business areas.\\n\\nThe Swiss-Swedish multinational, best known for robotics, motors, energy and automation, is one of the largest industrial engineering companies in the world, with Pang sharing responsibility for ABB’s global distribution R&amp;D strategy.\\nPang’s work spanned core domains such as robotic embodiment intelligence, industrial large models, next-generation controllers, industrial cyber-physical security, networked control, cloud/fog computing and 5G/6G/broadband satellite communications.\\nThese technologies are applied in ABB’s key sectors, including smart manufacturing, robotics, industrial drives, smart buildings and automation.\\nPang holds adjunct professorial positions at Sweden’s KTH Royal Institute of Technology and the University of Sydney in Australia, where his research has focused on embodied intelligence, cloud-edge automation and secure communication for 6G.\\nHis new appointment began this month, according to an announcement from Peking University’s rapidly growing School of Advanced Manufacturing and Robotics, established in 2016 amid China’s push for scientific innovation.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPang earned a bachelor’s degree in electronic engineering from Zhejiang University in 2002. He chose to gain industry experience first, working as a chip design engineer at Hangzhou Guoxin Technology Co., Ltd, rising to project manager and department manager.\\nThere, he led an R&amp;D team of more than 80 people, focusing on front-end chip design and system solutions. It was one of the few teams in China at the time capable of independently completing large-scale system-on-a-chip (SoC) designs.\\nIn 2009, Pang began an MBA in innovation and growth at the University of Turku in Finland. The following year, he started a PhD in electronic and computer systems at Sweden’s KTH and obtained his MBA and PhD in 2012 and 2013, respectively.\\nAfter completing his PhD, Pang joined the ABB Corporate Research Centre in Vasteras, rising from scientist to senior and principal positions, culminating in his appointment as a top senior principal scientist by ABB’s CTO, Bazmi Husain, in October 2019.\\nSince 2021, Pang has held several professorships at KTH and other international universities. His research is interdisciplinary, spanning intelligent robotics and autonomous systems.\\nPang’s work includes physical information neural networks, multimodal embodied intelligence models and high-performance cloud-based controllers. His expertise also covers cyber-physical security for autonomous systems, integrated networked computing and control design, as well as hardware for highly dynamic, agile robots.\\nHis proposal of a new paradigm for industrial control system design called Cloud-Fog Automation (CFA) has garnered attention from industry and academia.\\nThe CFA framework is a digital industrial automation reference architecture designed to achieve autonomous industrial cyber-physical systems through the integrated co-design of communication, computation and control.\\n\\n\\nPang received the ABB Group’s Corporate Research Inventor of the Year award in 2016, 2018 and 2021 – a particularly notable recognition as the annual prize is typically open to ABB’s global workforce of more than 100,000 researchers.\\nHe also secured and led more than 10 research projects funded by the European Union, Sweden and ABB Group, with total funding exceeding €9 million (US$10.4 million).\\n“I am an innovator and research leader passionate about industrial digital transformation, with over 20 years of experience across universities, large corporations and start-ups, spanning the entire innovation cycle,” Pang said in his résumé at the end of 2024.\\nChina’s national innovation-driven development strategy has explicitly listed intelligent robots as a “disruptive technology leading industrial transformation”.\\nLast year, the School of Advanced Manufacturing and Robotics was elevated from its previous position as a department within the College of Engineering – marking it as a critical platform for Peking University’s engineering research and innovation.\\nThe move aligns with China’s strategic priorities. The recently announced 15th five-year plan emphasises decisive breakthroughs in key core technologies, including integrated circuits, industrial machinery, advanced materials and biomanufacturing.\\nSweden, which Pang leaves behind, ranks second in the 2025 Global Innovation Index published by the World Intellectual Property Organization. China has just entered the top 10 for the first time.\\nPassionate about science?

            "title": "In nuclear-scarred Japan, Trump’s weapons testing call rankles bomb survivors",
            "description": "A Japanese atomic bomb survivors group that won the Nobel Peace Prize has strongly criticised US President Donald Trump’s surprise directive to begin nuclear weapons testing, calling it “utterly unacceptable”.\\nMore than 200,000 people were killed when the United States dropped two atomic bombs on Japan’s Hiroshima and Nagasaki during World War II, the only time nuclear weapons have been used during warfare.\\nSurvivors, known as hibakusha, have battled decades of physical and psychological trauma as well as the stigma that often came with being a victim.\\nAfter Trump said on Thursday that he had ordered the Pentagon to start nuclear weapons testing to equal China and Russia, Nobel laureate Nihon Hidankyo sent a letter of protest to the US embassy in Japan.\\nThe directive “directly contradicts the efforts by nations around the world striving for a peaceful world without nuclear weapons and is utterly unacceptable”, the survivors group said in the letter, a copy of which was obtained by Agence France-Presse on Friday.\\nThe mayor of Nagasaki also condemned Trump’s order, saying it “trampled on the efforts of people around the world who have been sweating blood and tears to realise a world without nuclear weapons”.\\n“If nuclear weapons testing were to start immediately, wouldn’t that make him unworthy of the Nobel Peace Prize?” Mayor Shiro Suzuki told reporters on Thursday, referring to Japanese Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi’s intention to nominate Trump for the award.\\n\\n\\nHidankyo, a grass roots movement of hibakusha, won the Nobel Peace Prize in 2024, and while accepting the prize, called on countries to abolish nuclear weapons.\\nTwo other atomic bomb survivor groups based in Hiroshima issued statements of protest, saying: “We strongly protest and firmly demand that no such experiments be conducted.”\\n“In a nuclear war, there are no winners or losers; all of humanity becomes the loser,” said Hiroshima Congress against A-and-H Bombs (Hiroshima Gensuikin) and the Hiroshima prefecture Federation of A-Bomb Victims Associations in a joint statement, which was also sent to the US embassy in Japan.\\n“The inhumane nature of nuclear weapons is evident from the devastation witnessed in Hiroshima and Nagasaki,” it added.\\nThe US dropped an atomic bomb on Hiroshima on August 6, 1945, and then another on Nagasaki three days later. Shortly afterwards, Japan surrendered, ending World War II.\\nAround 140,000 people died in Hiroshima and about 74,000 others in Nagasaki, including many from the effects of radiation exposure.\\nTrump’s announcement on nuclear testing left much unanswered – chiefly about whether he meant testing weapons systems or actually conducting test explosions, something the US has not done since 1992.\\nTakaichi, Japan’s first woman prime minister, this week announced she would nominate Trump for a Nobel Peace Prize as she lavished the US leader with praise during his visit to Tokyo.\\n",
