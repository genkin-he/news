            "title": "After delays, mammoth Grand Egyptian Museum by the Pyramids is finally opening",
            "description": "After two decades of anticipation and countless delays, the Grand Egyptian Museum is finally having its grand reveal.\\nThe museum, which was set to officially open on Saturday, highlights Egypt’s ancient civilisation and is a centrepiece of the government’s drive to boost the tourist industry, a major source of foreign currency in the cash-strapped country.\\nLocated just outside Cairo next to the famed Giza Pyramids, the US$1 billion mammoth facility is poised to become the world’s largest museum dedicated to a single civilisation with over 50,000 artefacts detailing life in ancient Egypt. By comparison, the Louvre Museum in Paris has about 35,000 pieces on display.\\nThe museum is one of the mega-projects championed by President Abdel-Fattah el-Sisi, who since taking office in 2014 embarked on massive investments in infrastructure with the aim of reviving an economy weakened by decades of stagnation and battered by the unrest that followed the 2011 Arab spring uprising.\\n\\nThe museum’s construction began in 2005, but work stopped for three years during the political turmoil that followed the 2011 uprising.\\nThe grand opening was postponed multiple times, most recently in July this year because of conflicts in the Middle East. World leaders were expected to attend the opening ceremony on Saturday.\\nDesigned by the Irish firm Heneghan Peng Architects, the museum, known as GEM, boasts a towering, triangular glass façade imitating the nearby pyramids.\\nIn its entrance atrium stands the granite colossus of one of Egypt’s most famed pharaohs, Ramesses the Great. The 3,200-year-old, 11-metre-tall statue was moved to the museum after decades of standing in the centre of a traffic-clogged roundabout in front of Cairo’s main railway station.\\nFrom the atrium, a grand six-storey staircase lined with ancient statues leads up to the main galleries and a view of the nearby pyramids. A bridge links the museum to the pyramids, allowing tourists to move between them either on foot or via electric, environment-friendly vehicles, according to museum officials.\\nThe museum includes 258,000 sq ft of permanent exhibition space, a children’s museum and conference and educational facilities, and a commercial area as well as a large conservation centre.\\n\\nThe 12 main galleries, which opened last year, exhibit antiquities spanning from prehistoric times to the Roman era, organised by era and by themes.\\nMany of the 50,000 artefacts in the GEM were moved from the Egyptian Museum, a packed, century-old building in downtown Cairo’s Tahrir Square. Others were recently unearthed from ancient cemeteries, including the Saqqara necropolis, another complex of pyramids and tombs about 22km (14 miles) south of the museum.\\nThe halls are equipped with advanced technology and feature multimedia presentations including mixed-reality shows to help explain ancient Egypt to new generations, said Ahmed Ghoneim, the museum’s CEO.\\n“We’re using the language that the Gen Z uses right now,” he said in an interview. “Gen Z doesn’t use any more the labels that we read as old people but rather use technology.”\\nSaturday’s grand opening would include the inauguration of two halls dedicated to the 5,000 artefacts from the collection of King Tutankhamun.\\nThe collection was being displayed in its entirety for the first time since British archaeologist Howard Carter discovered King Tut’s tomb in 1922 in the southern city of Luxor. The old Egyptian Museum did not have enough space to show all the tomb’s treasures at once.\\n\\nSome masterpieces were restored at the museum’s conservation centre, including the boy pharaoh’s three funeral beds and six chariots, said Jailan Mohamed, chief restorer at the conservation centre.\\nThey will be displayed along with his golden throne, his gold-covered sarcophagus and his burial mask, made of gold, quartzite, lapis lazuli and coloured glass. The mask’s beard was accidentally knocked off and hastily glued back on with epoxy in 2014, before a German-Egyptian team of experts fixed it the following year.\\nAnother centrepiece of the museum was the 4,600-year-old solar boat of King Khufu, the pharaoh who was credited with building the Great Pyramid of Giza.\\nThe 43-metre-long wooden boat, discovered in the 1950s, was buried next to the Great Pyramid for Khufu - or Cheops as he was also known - to use in the afterlife. In 2021, it was moved from its display site by the pyramids into the Grand Egyptian Museum on a remote-controlled vehicle imported from Belgium.\\nThe government hoped the museum would draw more tourists and provide the foreign currency Egypt needed to shore up its economy.\\nThe tourism sector suffered from years of political turmoil and violence following the 2011 Arab spring uprising. In recent years, the sector has started to recover from the coronavirus pandemic, and the effects of Russia’s war on Ukraine. Both Russia and Ukraine are a major source of tourists visiting Egypt.\\nA record number of 15.7 million visited the country in 2024, according to official figures, and the government aims to attract 30 million visitors by 2032.\\nAuthorities overhauled the whole area around the museum and the pyramids. Roads were paved and a metro station is being constructed outside the museum gates to ease access to the sites. An airport, Sphinx International Airport, was also opened west of Cairo - 40 minutes from the museum.\\nHassan Allam, CEO of Hassan Allam Holding, the firm operating the museum, said they were expecting between 15,000 and 20,000 visitors a day at the museum.\\n“The world has been waiting … Everyone’s excited,” he said.\\n",

            "title": "Chinese medicinal wines still have a place in TCM, treating arthritis, period pain and more",
            "description": "It might sound like the stuff of nightmares: Chinese medicinal shop shelves lined with jars containing snakes and lizards pickled in a murky mix of liquid and herbs. But they serve a healthy purpose.\\nChinese medicinal wines have been around for almost as long as traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) itself.\\nTo make them, snakes, geckos and other creatures are steeped in alcohol for months or years, along with herbs, to extract their perceived medicinal “essence”. They are used as powerful tonics to treat ailments from rheumatism to arthritis, and to boost male vitality by warming the body and promoting blood circulation.\\nThe popularity of Chinese medicinal wines in Hong Kong has waned since their heyday in the 1970s and ’80s, when mainland Chinese varieties such as Shi Quan Da Bu Jiu – “the 10 complete wellness wine” – were household names.\\n\\nHong Kong-based TCM practitioner Samuel To Ching-san cites several reasons for their fall in popularity.\\n“In the last few decades, alcohol has been seen as something detrimental to your health; you can’t be taking medicinal wines before driving or before work, and preparing Chinese medicinal wines takes time, something that modern lifestyles have less and less of,” he says.\\nBut according to To, it is the wines’ alcohol content that helps make them fast-acting and effective.\\n“Alcohol acts as a conduit, directing medicinal effects and helping the medicine reach the affected area quickly,” he says. “It also has a synergistic effect, dissolving the active components of herbs into the wine,” making it easier for the patient to absorb them.\\nTo adds, however, that Chinese medicinal wines’ efficacy is only relative to other forms of TCM; “the speed of modern medicine has left this advantage in the dust”.\\n\\nBrewing medicinal wines and elixirs has been part of Chinese culture for almost 2,000 years. Ancient oracle bones from the Shang dynasty (1600BC-1046BC) reveal the earliest uses of wine in rituals and medicine.\\nDuring the Han (206BC-AD220) and Jin (265-420) dynasties, Taoist alchemists concocted mystical elixirs in their quest for immortality, sometimes with dangerous results. They used cinnabar – a toxic ore of mercury – and rare minerals in medicinal wines.\\nLater, in the Tang (618-907) dynasty, Sun Simiao, known as China’s king of medicine, refined wine-based remedies for ailments ranging from fatigue to arthritis, recording the recipes in texts that would endure for centuries.\\nDuring the Ming dynasty (1368-1644), Chinese doctor Li Shizhen catalogued hundreds of tonics infused with everything from ginseng to wolfberries and even snake in his book, Bencao Gangmu, or the Compendium of Materia Medica, enshrining their use in Chinese medicine.\\nSnake wines are on the list of Hong Kong’s intangible cultural heritage. To make them, the defanged animals are gutted and then steamed and immersed in spirits such as yellow wine with medicinal herbs.\\nThe wine is aged for one to two years and is said to be good for “expelling wind and dampness”. In TCM, wind and dampness are related to joint and muscle pain, stiffness and swelling. Removing them from the body is also believed to boost core energy, strength and overall vitality.\\n\\nDepending on the combination of ingredients, medicinal wines can help with a variety of ailments related to the circulatory system, from rheumatism and joint pain to period pain, indigestion and cold hands and feet.\\nSnakes and lizards are not a necessary ingredient for these wines; many of them are infused with ingredients such as ginger, cinnamon, cloves, Sichuan peppercorns, safflower, goji berries and ginseng.\\nTo says that, because of the alcoholic nature of wine therapy, there are several things to keep in mind.\\n“People who are taking sleeping pills, antidepressants, antibiotics, anticoagulants, oral antidiabetic drugs, antihypertensives and even painkillers should not use wine therapy,” he warns.\\n“Sometimes it could worsen the condition; it’s best to consult your prescribing doctor to see if they can be taken together,” he adds.\\n\\nSince wine therapy usually needs to be taken over time, To suggests taking small shots daily.\\n“There are different ABVs [alcohol levels] when it comes to medicinal wines. Patients shouldn’t take more than 30ml a day for the stronger ones and no more than 50ml a day for the milder wines,” To says.\\n“It’s better to drink the wine after meals and not on an empty stomach, and if you’re taking it for wellness reasons such as warming up cold hands and feet, then I suggest drinking it in alternating weeks, such as one week on and one week off.”\\nTo also says that it is difficult to control medicinal wines’ potency.\\n“Depending on the length of time that it’s been infused and the quality of the herbs used, it is hard to gauge the efficacy of the wines. In contrast, it is a lot easier to gauge the effects of herbal medicine and acupuncture.”\\nDespite these caveats, To still believes that medicinal wine therapy has a place in TCM.\\n“It has fallen out of favour in recent years, but it is the best therapy for certain conditions if used correctly. We should not forget this part of TCM culture.”\\nLike what you read? Follow SCMP Lifestyle on Facebook, X and Instagram. You can also sign up for our eNewsletter here.\\n",

            "description": "OpenAI, Oracle and Related Digital will build a data centre campus of more than 1 gigawatt in Saline Township, Michigan, as part of their Stargate push to expand US artificial intelligence infrastructure capacity.\\nThe announcement made on Thursday underscores the AI industry’s surging appetite for computing power, driven by the pursuit of technology capable of matching or surpassing human intelligence.\\nThe companies said it was a multibillion-dollar investment, without disclosing the exact figure. Industry executives have said 1GW of computing power, enough to power roughly 750,000 US homes, can cost around US$50 billion.\\nThe construction is slated to begin in early 2026.\\nThe project is part of Oracle and OpenAI’s 4.5-GW Stargate expansion and, together with six other US sites, raises the infrastructure group’s planned capacity to more than 8GW and total investment to over US$450 billion in the next three years.\\nOpenAI said the move kept Stargate ahead of schedule to meet its US$500 billion, 10GW commitment. The start-up has shared few details on how it plans to fund the spending.\\n\\nEarlier this week, it completed a restructuring that frees the ChatGPT maker to move away from its nonprofit roots. Reuters has reported it was laying the groundwork for an initial public offering that could value the company at up to US$1 trillion.\\nBut surging valuations of AI companies and their massive AI spending commitments, which total more than US$1 trillion for OpenAI, have raised fears that the AI boom is inflating into a bubble.\\nOpenAI said on Thursday Related Digital would develop the Michigan project, which is expected to create more than 2,500 union construction jobs.\\n“This project will help ensure Michigan is a key part of building the AI infrastructure that will power the next generation of American innovation,” said Peter Hoeschele, OpenAI’s vice-president of industrial compute.\\n",

            "title": "Asia to play key role in decarbonisation amid shift to renewables: report",
            "description": "Carbon dioxide emissions are expected to peak globally next year, marking a turning point in the energy transition, with Asia set to play a prominent role in decarbonisation.\\nThe findings were revealed in a report by Rystad Energy released on Thursday, which noted that while the shift to renewable energy had gained momentum, peak oil demand was set to occur only by the 2030s, with near-term demand for fossil fuels including gas likely to be resilient.\\nEmerging countries such as Pakistan and Thailand are among leaders in renewable energy adoption, putting the world on track for a 1.9 degree Celsius temperature rise by 2100 – below the upper range of the 2015 Paris Agreement.\\nWhile the world moves from growth to decline in emissions, the report urges faster deployment of renewables to limit warming to 1.5 degrees or the lower range of the Paris deal.\\nBy 2030, low-carbon sources were expected to capture 46 per cent of all energy investment, compared with 30 per cent for fossil fuels, with electricity grids accounting for 24 per cent, the report said.\\n\\nAsia dominates low-carbon energy deployment across all major technologies, accounting for 65 per cent of solar, 64 per cent of wind, 48 per cent of hydrogen, and 41 per cent of battery investment in 2025.\\n“This largely reflects China’s drive for energy independence from oil and gas imports, transiting vulnerable maritime chokepoints, and increasingly contentious supplier nations,” the report said.\\nFossil fuels still provided the bulk of electricity generation globally, but their share was eroding rapidly, it added.\\nAsia is taking the lead in global electrification, with eight of the top 10 countries showing the highest share of electricity in their useful energy mix located in the region, according to Rystad.\\nIt identified Bangladesh, Vietnam, the Philippines and Malaysia among nations which had rapidly advanced electrification, leapfrogging traditional energy systems.\\nThe report provides a ray of hope ahead of the UN Cop30 climate change conference from November 10 to 21 in the Brazilian city of Belem, showing that the effects of climate change can be limited by accelerating national climate goals.\\nElectricity consumption patterns are lopsided as two-thirds of the power source are dominated by just seven countries in the world, with China and the United States among the biggest users.\\nLooking ahead, China is expected to experience the largest absolute growth, adding about 2,400 terawatt hours of demand by 2035 as electrification deepens. India, meanwhile, is projected to record the fastest relative growth, more than doubling its demand as urbanisation and rising incomes reshape lifestyles, according to the Rystad report.\\n\\n\\nIn a separate report released on Thursday by civil society organisations and communities including the Centre for Energy, Ecology, and Development, EarthRights International and Energy Shift Southeast Asia, the groups urged Asean to move away from fossil fuels.\\n“Southeast Asia stands at the forefront of the climate and biodiversity crisis,” the groups said. “Our region – home to the Coral Triangle and some of the world’s richest ecosystems – faces worsening heatwaves, floods, and rising seas. Addressing these crises is no longer optional; it is essential for our collective survival.”\\nThe joint call comes at a time when the Philippines, a climate-vulnerable nation, assumes the chairmanship of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations in 2026, following Malaysia’s term.\\nWith Cop30 approaching, the groups reiterated the need for Southeast Asian governments to align their nationally determined contributions with the 1.5-degree goal.\\nThey also urged Global North countries to urgently deliver climate finance.\\nThe Cop30 conference will be held at a time when the US under President Donald Trump remains largely disengaged from climate challenges, following his successive orders to withdraw the world’s largest economy from the 2015 Paris Agreement.\\n\\nA Lancet report released on Wednesday also underscored the need for the transition, warning that the costs of overreliance on fossil fuels were already taking a toll on health systems and livelihoods, with 13 of 20 indicators tracking health threats reaching unprecedented levels.\\nIt said the warming effects of climate change had seen the rate of heat-related deaths surge 23 per cent since the 1990s, to 546,000 a year, while air pollution from the continued burning of fossil fuels had resulted in a staggering 2.5 million deaths every year.\\n“This Lancet report is a devastating global health audit, and the findings are clear: our addiction to fossil fuels is killing us by the millions,” Harjeet Singh, climate activist and founding director of Satat Sampada Climate Foundation, told This Week in Asia.\\nDependence on fossil fuels also puts an unbearable strain on government budgets, with a total of US$956 billion spent on net fossil fuel subsidies in 2023. This increased financial pressure and dwarfed the US$300 billion a year that the international community committed at Cop29 to tackle climate change worldwide, the Lancet report added.\\n“This is economic self-sabotage. We lost over a trillion dollars globally last year in heat-related labour alone, while governments simultaneously handed nearly a trillion dollars in subsidies to the very industry causing the crisis,” Singh said.\\n“The only solution is to turn off the tap.”\\n",

            "description": "Jensen Huang’s viral meal is driving a sharp rally in South Korea’s fried chicken-related stocks.\\nThe Nvidia CEO shared beers with Samsung Electronics Chair Jay Y. Lee and Hyundai Motor Executive Chair Chung Eui-sun at a local restaurant, Kkanbu Chicken, on Thursday evening.\\nWhile Kkanbu is not publicly listed, shares of rival Kyochon F&amp;B surged as much as 20 per cent on Friday after photos and videos of the gathering circulated widely on social media.\\nSouth Korean poultry processor Cherrybro also soared by the daily limit of 30 per cent, with trading volume about 200 times its average. Neuromeka, a Kosdaq-listed company that makes chicken-frying robots, also soared.\\nThe episode reflects how virality and memes continue to influence South Korea’s stock market, where risk-seeking traders often chase short-term gains tied to cultural, political or economic moments in the spotlight. These rallies, typically in small-cap Kosdaq stocks, are rarely driven by fundamentals and often lack any real link to company operations.\\n\\nIn August, shares of South Korean pen maker MonAmi surged after US leader Donald Trump praised President Lee Jae-myung’s pen during their first in-person meeting at the White House.\\nHuang, in South Korea this week for the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation CEO summit, was seen handing out chicken to a policeman and onlookers gathered outside the restaurant to catch a glimpse of him.\\nIt is not the first time Huang has acted as a stock market kingmaker.

            "description": "Feel strongly about these letters, or any other aspects of the news?

Submissions should not exceed 400 words\\nHalloween is surely one of the most fun and frivolous of all the annual festivities in Hong Kong. On October 31 every year, Lan Kwai Fong is thronged with party-goers in their spooky get-ups, while children run around, wide-eyed and delighted, trick-or-treating with their friends.\\nContrary to the popular belief that Halloween is an American custom, most will be surprised to learn that the origins of Halloween are, in fact, Irish and we have been celebrating it for over 2,000 years.\\nThe ancient Celts called it Samhain (pronounced sow-win) and it was originally celebrated to mark the end of the harvest season and the start of winter. They believed that Samhain was the time of year when the spirit realm was closest to the earthly world, and the souls of the dead would cross to the other side. To blend in with the wandering spirits, the ancients Celts wore masks to disguise themselves and lit large communal fires to ward off evil spirits and ghouls – familiar Halloween practices that continue today all over the world.\\nOther Halloween traditions that came from Ireland include carving faces into turnips (later pumpkins) as a form of protection, and trick-or-treating, where people would go from door to door in fabric masks, offering prayers for the dead in exchange for food.\\nThe endurance of Halloween’s relevance and appeal is a result of the many Irish emigrants who brought the traditions of the harvest celebration to their new homes in America and other countries around the world. These customs and traditions were embraced and developed into the Halloween we know and love today.\\nSo whether you are trick-or-treating with your family today or dressing up for a night out with your friends in LKF, remember that Ireland is the home of Halloween.\\nJennifer Bourke, consul general of Ireland to Hong Kong and Macau\\nIs South Korea a reliable US ally?\\nAmid international turbulence and the strengthening of relations between China, Russia and North Korea, the United States, Japan and South Korea are attempting to further enhance trilateral cooperation. Thus, during the recent meeting between the US Secretary of State and the foreign ministers of Japan and South Korea, the countries agreed to continue conducting the trilateral multi-domain exercise Freedom Edge to counter the threat posed by North Korea’s nuclear and ballistic missile programmes.\\nHowever, it is worth considering whether Seoul is a reliable ally.\\nLast year, an official at the Korea Defence Intelligence Command (KDIC) was arrested for leaking classified data, including a list of undercover operatives who were carrying out missions in China and Russia.\\nThis came at a time when South Korea was expanding military intelligence sharing with the US and Japan to help guard against North Korea and China. It prompted the KDIC to recall undercover agents back home as many of them had no diplomatic immunity, which left them vulnerable to arrests, threats and blackmail in foreign countries. Earlier, a major leak was reported at the command in 2018.\\nIn addition, South Korean spies seem to be failing abroad. In March 2024, it was reported that a South Korean was detained in Russia on spying charges. In October 2024, it was confirmed that another South Korean was arrested in China for spying. Washington and Tokyo should take a closer look at cooperation with Seoul.\\nBenjamin Campbell, Alabama, US\\nBritish flags should not be used to intimidate\\nCliff Buddle is correct in his article, “A national flag should be a symbol of unity not of prejudice and divisiveness” (October 19).\\nThe far right in the United Kingdom, including the populist Reform party, utilise the union jack, often displayed upside down, to confer on themselves alone self-righteous patriotism. When held by a jack-booted thug, the flag becomes threatening. Others even shroud themselves in flags on marches as if they are protecting themselves from “evil outside forces”, i.e. foreigners.\\nIt was, as Buddle described, an excellent trick for Labour to produce hundreds of jolly paper union jacks for delegates to wave at their party conference. It made the use of our national flags to intimidate look rather foolish.\\nSally Wilton, Dorset, UK\\n",

            "title": "Plastic rain: Indonesia sounds alarm as microplastics found in Jakarta’s rainwater",
            "description": "A new study has found that rainwater in Indonesia’s capital Jakarta contains microplastics and potentially other toxic chemicals harmful to public health, raising alarm over the pervasiveness of such particles in the country’s biome – down to food consumed.\\nRaindrops were picking up microplastics floating in Jakarta’s, Indonesia’s National Research and Innovation Agency (BRIN) revealed in its newest study on October 17. Samples of rainwater collected in coastal areas of Jakarta were found to contain about 15 microplastic particles for every one square metre (11 sq ft) per day.\\n“If a house has an area of around 100 square metres (1,080 sq ft), it means that every day it will be hit by [rainwater] with 1,500 microplastic particles,” Muhammad Reza Cordova, a BRIN researcher who took part in the study, told This Week in Asia.\\nResearchers found that these microscopic flakes contained synthetic fibres from clothing, polymers from tyres, and smaller pieces of plastics that broke down from combustion and degradation, among others.\\n“We already suspected that there were microplastics in the air. But it was surprising because we thought the numbers wouldn’t be that high. We thought there would be just one or two microplastic particles [per square metre],” Muhammad said.\\n\\nAccording to him, rain helps trap microplastics in the air so “the higher the rainfall, the more microplastics are cleaned from the air we breathe every day”.\\nHowever, the study should be an “alarm” for the public as it showed that microplastics were so widespread in Indonesia that they could be found “in all kinds of metrics or ecosystem levels, from water to soil and air”, Muhammad said.\\nIn August, Muhammad and his team found microplastic particles and fibres in deep sea barnacles at a depth of 200 metres (656 feet) in the northern Maluku and southwestern Philippine seas, likely from abandoned fishing gear.\\nLast year, a collaborative study between BRIN and several universities in Indonesia and China detected microplastic particles five metres (16 feet) below the surface in the water surrounding the archipelago, from North Java and North Sulawesi to the Maluku Sea.\\nMicroplastics have also been found in water collected on Japan’s Mount Fuji and Mount Oyama, as well as in rain from several national parks in the western United States.\\nDeadly cocktail\\nYuyun Ismawati, senior adviser at Nexus3 Foundation, a non-governmental organisation advocating for the eradication of dangerous chemicals, said that microplastics were risky to health as they were a “magnet” for air pollutants and toxic additive chemicals that made up a plastic fibre.\\n“What worries me isn’t just the microplastics; I’m more concerned about the chemicals [in microplastics]. Plastic fibre is made with chemical additives so that the plastic is flexible, durable in the air, and when exposed to sunlight, it does not easily fragment,” the London-based adviser said.\\n“There’s a cocktail effect of all the existing pollutants that makes it scary. If people inhale or come into contact with microplastics in rainwater, they also [inhale] the chemicals in them.”\\nThere’s a cocktail effect of all the existing pollutants that makes it scary\\nYuyun Ismawati, senior adviser at Nexus3 Foundation\\nAccording to Yuyun, only a fraction of these compounds are detectable, while “ultra fine” particles are hard to measure due to technology limitations in Indonesia to sample and examine them.\\nMultiple studies have found that exposure to microplastics can cause serious health impacts, such as hormonal disruption, damage to organs like lungs and kidneys and cancer development.\\nExperts said that weak management of plastic waste was to blame for the plastic rain phenomenon.\\n“The source is from open dumping sites, temporary waste storage sites and landfills. Many Indonesian landfills are not covered or not operated properly, so that when plastics are fragmented, they break into small particles and these become airborne,” Yuyun said.\\n\\n\\nIn Indonesia, microplastics are also found in the very food that they eat. Last year, Nexus3 Foundation and environmental group The Gita Pertiwi Foundation found microplastics in “the blood, meat and innards” of two cows that grazed the soils in two landfills in Central Java, Yuyun said.\\nAnother study by Cornell University last year, which mapped microplastic uptake across 109 countries, found that Indonesians topped the chart with 15 grams (0.5 ounces) of microplastics consumed per month, more than any other country.\\nMalaysians ranked second at 12 grams (0.4 ounces) per month, followed by Filipinos and Vietnamese, who consumed 11 grams (0.3 ounces) per month. In Indonesia, most of the microplastics came from seafood, the study said.\\nMask up\\nResponding to the study, Health Minister Budi Sadikin on Tuesday recommended Jakartans to mask up while doing outdoor activities, or “try not to walk outside after it rains”.\\nMuhammad argued, however, that it was better to breathe post-rain air in Jakarta as the rain had cleansed it of pollutants, rather than when it was dry.\\n“We recommend using the masks when it’s dry, but use the ones that are made from natural fibres like cotton. Medical masks are disposable, and we are concerned that this will increase plastic waste, as medical masks contain plastic polymers,” he said.\\nOn Tuesday, Jakarta Governor Pramono Anung said that the city of 10 million would soon have a waste-to-energy plant.\\n\\nBut Muhammad said that was only part of the solution as it did not address the root of the problem. “We must stop it at the source by reducing single-use plastics, as 70 per cent of our plastics production is single-use. If not managed properly, it will become a time bomb for us,” he said.\\nIn Indonesia, the quality of plastic made for consumer products is “poor”, so they cannot be recycled and end up in landfill, while plastic recycling companies prefer to import plastic from abroad because the quality is better, according to Yuyun.\\nAs microplastics have permeated every corner of the Earth, Yuyun also urged countries to agree on the United Nations Plastics Treaty, which would establish legally binding rules around plastic disposal and production.\\nIn August, the treaty’s latest negotiation in Geneva ended in another deadlock as like-minded oil states pushed for better waste collection and recycling infrastructure for plastics, which are made using fossil fuels, while others advocated for reducing plastic production.\\n",
