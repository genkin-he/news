            "title": "Xi-Carney talks open door for Canada to ‘make up for lost time’ with China",
            "description": "The leaders of China and Canada held their first formal talks since 2017 on Friday, with both sides agreeing to revive exchanges and cooperation in an effort to repair strained ties.\\nChinese President Xi Jinping met Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney on the sidelines of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (Apec) summit in Gyeongju, South Korea, telling him that relations showed a “trend of recovery and positive development” following their nations’ mutual efforts.\\n“[China] is willing to work with Canada to take this meeting as an opportunity to bring China-Canada relations back onto the right track,” Xi said, according to the state news agency, Xinhua.\\n\\n\\nThe Chinese leader added that China and Canada should view each other “correctly” and expand cooperation in areas ranging from trade and economy to energy while deepening people-to-people exchanges. The Xinhua report said the two leaders agreed to push to resolve economic issues.\\nCarney said the new Canadian government highly valued its ties with Beijing, looked forward to restarting bilateral cooperation and sought to “make up for lost time”, a reference to heightened tensions between the two countries in recent years, according to Xinhua.\\nAn official Canadian statement said the two leaders agreed that the talks – which Canadian media said lasted 39 minutes – marked a “turning point in the bilateral relationship”, and they committed to renewing ties in a pragmatic way.\\n“Both leaders directed their officials to move quickly to resolve outstanding trade issues and irritants,” the statement from Ottawa said, adding that Carney had accepted Xi’s invitation to visit China at a mutually convenient time.\\nThe meeting came on the back of years of fraught ties between China and Canada, partly stemming from the 2018 tit-for-tat arrests of Huawei Technologies executive Meng Wanzhou in Vancouver at the request of the US, and two Canadians living in China accused of espionage.\\nCanada had said Beijing was carrying out “hostage diplomacy” during a stand-off that only ended in 2021 when a deal with US prosecutors led to the release of Meng and the Canadians Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor.\\nTensions escalated further in 2023 amid allegations of Chinese interference in Canadian elections and attempts to intimidate lawmakers, culminating in the expulsion of a Chinese diplomat.\\nTrade ties have also remained tense. Last year, former prime minister Justin Trudeau aligned with Washington in imposing 100 per cent tariffs on Chinese electric vehicles. China retaliated by slapping duties on canola, pork and seafood.\\nThe meeting on Friday indicated an effort by Carney, who became prime minister in March, to repair ties with Beijing as his own country navigates an increasingly complex relationship with the US.\\nCanada has been working on a tariff deal with US President Donald Trump but the American leader last week said he was ending negotiations with Ottawa after a Canadian province aired a television ad featuring former president Ronald Reagan that criticised the tariffs.\\n\\n\\nAhead of his meeting with Xi, Carney told reporters, “We will explore what we can build on”.\\n“This is our second-largest trading partner. This is the second-largest economy in the world,” Carney said. “This is one of the most influential actors in terms of the global system, such as it is, and it is a country with whom we had no senior-level contact for seven years.”\\nXi, who is on a three-day visit to South Korea until Saturday, also met Japan’s Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi and Thailand’s Prime Minister Anutin Charnvirakul on Friday and is expected to meet other world leaders, including South Korean President Lee Jae-myung.\\nEarlier on Friday, Xi delivered remarks to leaders at the Apec meeting where he called on them to stabilise and protect global supply chains.\\nAustralian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese posted a photograph of himself shaking hands with Xi on social media with the caption: “Good to meet informally with President Xi at the Apec Summit in South Korea today”.\\n",

            "title": "Air pollution threatens Southeast Asia with more deaths, US$600 billion losses by 2050: study",
            "description": "Deaths from air pollution in Southeast Asia could rise by nearly 10 per cent and cost the region almost US$600 billion by 2050 unless more effective action is taken, a new study has warned.\\nThe research – published in the journal Environment International earlier this month – modelled the potential rise in premature deaths and associated economic losses across three different climate change scenarios, each defined by levels of greenhouse gas emissions.\\nFindings revealed the region is expected to lose US$591 billion by 2050 under the high emissions scenario, which is characterised by a warmer and drier climate. Deaths are expected to see the largest increase in this scenario, with a 9.6 per cent rise from 2019.\\nSteve Yim, director of the Centre for Climate Change and Environmental Health at Nanyang Technological University (NTU), told This Week in Asia that the research aimed to encourage discussion between nations in tackling the health and economic impacts of air pollution.\\n“Climate change is projected to largely reshape the weather system and even bring more extreme weather events in Southeast Asia,” said Yim, who led the study. He added that air pollution was one of the most urgent environmental problems in the region, and posed a significant health burden.\\n\\nIn 2019, there were 1,147,259 premature deaths caused by air pollution in Southeast Asia, costing the region US$432 billion, the study said.\\nAccording to the World Health Organization, long-term exposure to pollutants increases the risks of heart diseases, stroke and cancer.\\nA medium level of emissions presented the most optimistic scenario, where economic loss was estimated at US$246 billion, and premature deaths projected to fall 1.8 per cent from 2019.\\nThis was because in this scenario, the region would experience slightly warmer temperatures with a modest increase in rainfall and humidity, and such wetter conditions would support the removal of pollutants, Yim told This Week in Asia.\\nIn comparison, the lowest emissions scenario would see a lower temperature and lesser rainfall – a favourable climate for the formation of PM2.5, which are fine particulates of less than 2.5 microns.\\nAccording to a 2019 study by the World Bank, air pollution caused 6.4 million premature deaths that year, with death rates significantly higher in low- and lower-middle-income countries. The estimated cost of health damage associated with air pollution was US$8.1 trillion – 6.1 per cent of global GDP.\\nIn 2020, air pollution led to 40,000 deaths and cost Tokyo US$43 billion, according to Swiss air quality tracker IQAir. In Shanghai in 2020, air pollution caused 39,000 deaths and the city lost US$19 billion.\\n\\n\\nThe new research by Yim’s team showed that despite estimated increases in deaths and economic loss, PM2.5 concentration was projected to decrease regionally.\\nYim noted that while some areas might experience lower concentration levels due to higher temperatures inducing rainfall, hotspots in Indonesia and Thailand would continue to experience an increase in pollution levels, and drive health and economic burden.\\nThese include subregions such as southern Indonesia and southern Thailand, which are densely populated and experience lesser rainfall, leading to the accumulation of pollutants.\\nThe study estimated that among all states, Indonesia and Thailand would experience the highest economic losses and increase in premature deaths across all emissions scenarios.\\nIndonesia is expected to lose US$307 billion and US$213 billion in the high and low emissions scenarios respectively, while Thailand’s projected losses stand at US$121 billion and US$101 billion.\\nWhile air pollution is a global issue, its impacts are felt unevenly with developing countries likely to experience a greater economic burden, according to Joseph Sung, co-author of the study.\\nEconomic loss included direct costs such as healthcare, as well as indirect costs such as the labour and productivity loss, said Sung, the dean of NTU’s Lee Kong Chian School of Medicine.\\n“The air pollution situation in developing countries is already more serious, and yet there’s a lot of room for improvement in their healthcare systems,” Sung told This Week in Asia. “Those who suffer from complications take longer to get better, or not at all, so the economic impact can be much higher than developed countries.”\\n\\nYim said the findings highlighted the need to consider localised characteristics for climate mitigation policies.\\n“For example, current climate mitigation policies, such as using alternative fuels to lower carbon dioxide emissions, may inadvertently exacerbate health and economic burdens in vulnerable regions,” he said.\\nYim also called for greater regional collaboration in tackling the impacts of air pollution, adding that pollution in Southeast Asia was often transboundary.\\nThe region experiences recurring periods of transboundary haze, and Malaysia and Singapore are often the worst hit during the dry season, when forest fires plague Indonesia.\\n",

            "description": "The centrist D66 party won the knife-edge Dutch election, local news agency ANP projected on Friday, saying its vote tally showed far-right leader Geert Wilders could not close the gap.\\nThat would put D66 leader Rob Jetten on track to become the youngest leader of the European Union’s fifth-largest economy, but lengthy coalition negotiations lie ahead.\\nANP’s projections were immediately cited by multiple Dutch news outlets, including public broadcaster NOS.\\nWith just one constituency and overseas postal votes still to be counted, Jetten holds a razor-thin lead of 15,155 votes over Wilders.\\nThe postal votes are already being counted in The Hague, but the result will not be announced before Monday evening at the earliest.\\n\\nExpats have historically broken for more centrist and left-wing parties. At the last election in 2023, D66 outscored the PVV by nearly 3,000 postal votes.\\nOn Tuesday, top politicians will come together in parliament to elect a so-called “scout”, who will sound out parties to see who is prepared to work with whom.\\nThe leader of the party with the most votes picks the scout and takes the lead in the arduous coalition-building process, which will last several months.\\nUntil then, caretaker Prime Minister Dick Schoof remains in charge. “I expect I will still be PM at Christmas,” he said earlier on Friday.\\nAll parties have excluded Wilders, who torpedoed the last coalition by pulling out the PVV in a row over immigration.\\n\\nGrand coalition\\nIf confirmed as election winner, Jetten must form a coalition of like-minded parties with a majority of at least 76 seats in the 150 member parliament.\\nHis main path to that appears to be a form of “grand coalition” with the centre-right CDA (18 seats), the liberal VVD (22) and the left-wing Green/Labour group (20). Jetten’s D66 party has 26 seats.\\nBut there are question marks about whether the VVD and Green/Labour will work together.\\nVVD leader Dilan Yesilgoz said before the election, an alliance with Green/Labour “would not work”, and she wanted a centre-right coalition.\\nOn Monday, the Green/Labour group will elect a new leader after former EU vice-president Frans Timmermans stepped down.\\nYesilgoz and Timmermans are known to have a difficult relationship, so a new Green/Labour leader could ease the path to a partnership.\\nAlthough Wilders saw support collapse, other far-right parties performed well.\\nThe Forum for Democracy (FvD), a nationalist party that wants to withdraw from the EU’s Schengen system of open borders, more than doubled its vote.\\nIt will have seven MPs in the new parliament, from three before. Wilders has ruled out working with them, finding them too extreme.\\nThe hard-right JA21 party, which has described itself as a “conservative liberal party with a positive view of the Netherlands”, jumped from one seat to nine.\\n",

            "description": "Japan – with China, North Korea and Russia in mind – plans to test its hypersonic missile-tracking technology in space, after its new HTV-X cargo spacecraft completes a resupply mission at the International Space Station.\\nThe spacecraft was launched from the Tanegashima Space Centre on Sunday, carried by an H3 rocket. It arrived at the ISS on Thursday, where it was captured by the station’s robotic arm and docked in.\\nOn board is 4.4 tonnes of food and supplies as well as scientific research materials that will be delivered to the ISS.\\n\\nThe spacecraft will remain berthed at the space station for about three months. After that, it will serve as a flying experimental platform in low-Earth orbit “for exploitation of future space technologies” for up to 18 months, according to the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency.\\nIt will then be destroyed when it re-enters Earth’s atmosphere and burns up.\\nThe HTV-X is also carrying infrared sensors deployed by Japan’s Ministry of Defence, which has said will be used to monitor the activities of a hypersonic glide vehicle, or HGV, flying at least five times the speed of sound.\\nThe ministry earmarked 3.8 billion yen (US$24.7 million) in last year’s defence budget for the project, which it said would use the “space experimental platforms” of Japan’s new space station resupply vehicle, the HTV-X, to detect and track an HGV.\\nAccording to Japanese media reports, a projectile will be launched that simulates a hypersonic missile near Japan to evaluate how well the HTV-X’s infrared sensors can detect and track the projectile’s heat signature.\\nThe Nikkei newspaper reported that if the missile-tracking technology on the HTV-X was proven effective, satellites would be equipped with the infrared sensors.\\nAn HGV is a type of hypersonic weapon that uses a rocket booster to get to a high altitude and speed before the vehicle separates and glides towards its target at hypersonic speed.\\nChina’s DF-17 and Russia’s Avangard are both known to be operational HGV missiles. North Korea also claims to have successfully test-fired at least two HGV missiles, the Hwasong-8 and Hwasong-16B.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAs its regional rivals expand their hypersonic capabilities, Japan is also working to develop the technology. That includes space-based monitoring, since land-based early warning systems have blind spots and would not provide enough time to respond to a hypersonic missile launched from a neighbouring country.\\nJapan is also developing a hypersonic weapon for “island defence” known as the Hyper-Velocity Gliding Projectile, or HVGP – a project under way since 2018.\\nThe HTV-X spacecraft was built by Mitsubishi Heavy Industries for the Japanese space agency. It also worked on the previous HTV spacecraft, which was also known as the H-II Transfer Vehicle and Kounotori or “White Stork”. That cargo transporter carried out nine successful resupply missions to the ISS between 2009 and 2020.\\nCompared to its predecessor, the new HTV-X has a similar launching weight of about 16 tonnes – 6 tonnes of which is cargo load in low-Earth orbit. Its most notable enhancement is an extended operation time that will provide on-orbit experimental opportunities for up to 1½ years, according to Mitsubishi Heavy Industries.\\n",

            "description": "Chinese President Xi Jinping said conflicts and disagreements should not define bilateral ties with Tokyo, while calling for “a correct understanding of China” in his first sit-down meeting with the new Japanese prime minister.\\nThe 30-minute discussion with Sanae Takaichi, who was formally sworn into office last week, took place on the sidelines of the two-day Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (Apec) summit that started on Friday in Gyeongju, South Korea.\\n“The two countries should properly manage differences by focusing on the bigger picture, seeking common ground while reserving differences,” Xi was quoted as saying by state broadcaster CCTV.\\n“Efforts should be made to prevent conflicts and disagreements from defining the broader bilateral relationship.”\\nThe two leaders largely kept to the diplomatic groundwork laid out in previous meetings between the countries’ leaders, reaffirming their stance to pursue “a strategically and mutually beneficial relationship” and build constructive and stable ties.\\n\\nFor her part, Takaichi acknowledged the array of lingering issues and challenges between Tokyo and Beijing. But she voiced hope about tackling them head on and enhancing mutual understanding.\\n“I hope to engage in candid dialogue with President Xi and deepen the relationship between the two leaders,” Takaichi said.\\nOn Friday, Takaichi said at a press briefing after the meeting that she raised their countries’ territorial disputes, the detention and safety of Japanese nationals in China, Beijing’s import restrictions on Japanese beef and seafood products, and rare earths.\\nTheir first in-person meeting came after the countries’ top diplomats spoke by phone on Tuesday, with Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi referring to “positive signals” from Japan’s new cabinet and urging it to take a solid “first step” in its engagement with China.\\nWang added that historical issues and the Taiwan question were fundamental matters in bilateral ties.\\nDuring the call, Japanese Foreign Minister Toshimitsu Motegi raised “strong concerns regarding China’s export control measures on rare earths”, while calling for remaining agricultural trade restrictions to be lifted.\\nMeanwhile, on Friday, Xi said in his opening remarks that he hoped to maintain communication with Takaichi and “work together to develop Sino-Japanese relations along the right track”.\\nBeijing and Tokyo share strong economic ties as trading partners, but they are frequently tested by historical mistrust, territorial disputes and Japan’s alliance with the United States.\\nIn Beijing, there are growing worries that Takaichi’s surprise elevation to prime minister might strain ties with Beijing because of her nationalistic views and hawkish security policies.\\nIn a sign of wariness towards her hardline foreign policies, Xi refrained from sending a congratulatory message to Takaichi, a departure from the precedent set with three previous prime ministers, including her successor, Shigeru Ishiba.\\n\\n\\nTakaichi has long been known for her hardline views: criticising China’s growing military presence in the region and adopting a nationalist tone on Japan’s wartime history.\\nHer past stance on visiting Yasukuni Shrine – a regular sore point that strains ties with Japan’s neighbours – and her close bond with Taiwan are considered potential flashpoints facing Sino-Japanese ties going forward.\\nBeijing sees Taiwan as part of China to be reunited by force if necessary. Most countries, including the US, do not recognise Taiwan as an independent state, but Washington is opposed to any attempt to take the self-ruled island by force and is committed to supplying it with weapons.\\nIn addition to her frequent engagement with Taiwanese officials in the past, she has picked some pro-Taiwan politicians for cabinet positions, including Chief Cabinet Secretary Minoru Kihara, the prime minister’s right-hand cabinet official. The former defence minister is a staunch supporter of Taiwan and is a senior member of the Japan-Taiwan parliamentary league.\\nXi urged Takaichi to uphold important agreements regarding historical issues and Taiwan, ensuring that the foundation of Sino-Japanese relations remains intact and unshaken, according to CCTV.\\nThe Japanese leader mentioned that Xi raised the Taiwan issue first and that they discussed it.\\nOn the matter of Yasukuni Shrine, Takaichi appeared to adopt a flexible and pragmatic stance, opting to skip visits during its three-day autumn festival two weeks ago.\\nOne of her first acts as prime minister was to announce a defence spending target of 2 per cent of GDP within the current financial year ending in March, accelerating the timeline from the original goal set for the 2027 financial year.\\nAnd in a policy address last week, Takaichi called China an “important neighbour” and said Tokyo needed to foster “constructive and stable” ties with Beijing and promote a “strategic and mutually beneficial” relationship.\\nBut she also emphasised her government’s commitment to bolstering multilateral security ties with the US and South Korea and involvement in the Quad, a strategic security dialogue that also includes the US, Australia and India.\\nA close ally of the US, Japan hosts the biggest concentration of the US military abroad. US President Donald Trump and Takaichi signed an agreement on Tuesday “securing” supplies of critical minerals and rare earths.\\nThe move was seen as a counterapproach to Beijing’s strong grip on rare earths, while announcing the “golden age” of their countries’ alliance.\\n",

            "title": "Philippines’ Heart Evangelista shares ‘humble enough’ quote after new accusation",
            "description": "Filipino actress-turned-influencer Heart Evangelista has shared a quote about successful people who do not step on others, as she continues to fend off accusations of her being a “nepo-wife” and is exploring legal options against her critics.\\nThe 40-year-old is married to Senator Francis “Chiz” Escudero, who was ousted as senate president in September after being linked to the country’s 545 billion peso (US$9.3 billion) flood-control corruption scandal.\\nSince the scandal erupted in July, those with even tenuous links to it – such as Evangelista – have had their lifestyles scrutinised. The fashion influencer has been defending herself on her favourite medium: social media.\\nOn Wednesday, she shared a post from British author Vex King, known for his bestseller, Good Vibes, Good Life.\\n“I’ve stopped being inspired by loud success. What moves me now are the people who rise without selling their soul or stepping on others,” the post read. “Those who achieve incredible things without constantly chasing relevance. The ones who live what they preach and treat people kindly, whether or not the cameras are rolling. Those who know their worth but are humble enough to know they aren’t above anyone else. That’s the kind of greatness I aspire to – quiet, steady, and real.”\\nEvangelista did not add a caption to the post, nor did she mention who it was in reference to, but commenters pointed to a recent criticism by actor-host Vice Ganda, according to the Inquirer newspaper.\\n\\nIn an October 24 episode of It’s Showtime, a TV variety show, Ganda appeared to make snide remarks about the fashion icon by describing a school in “Heart Evangelista’s province” of Sorsogon, Escudero’s bailiwick, as bulok, a Filipino word for decay.\\n“I went to a place in Heart Evangelista’s province, where a school didn’t have reading materials. So I had the school built,” Ganda said, as quoted by the Manila Bulletin.\\nHis remarks caused Evangelista’s personal assistant, Resty Rosell, to defend her on social media the day after, saying: “Please call DepEd [the Department of Education] because DepEd has a BUDGET for the school buildings and reading materials you are talking about. What is your intention in mentioning Heart’s name? For what? Just to have something to say?”\\nRosell then went on to list all the charity works Evangelista had done in Sorsogon, asking Ganda: “Is this the province you are talking about?”\\nOn Wednesday, the province’s mayor Wennie Raffalo-Romano told Panay News: “I would like to emphasise that Ms. Heart Evangelista-Escudero has nothing to do with this issue.”\\nEvangelista also faced another controversy recently when social media users circulated photos of a rare paraiba tourmaline ring she had received from her husband for her birthday last year, along with an estimated 57 million peso price tag and screenshots from luxury jewellery sites for comparison, according to the Inquirer report.\\n\\nComments on the posts questioned where Escudero supposedly got the money to buy such a lavish piece, given that his declared net worth as of December last year was only 18.8 million pesos. “His net worth is only 18.8 million but the ring is 57 million? Math isn’t mathing,” one user posted.\\nEvangelista has previously said she worked hard to earn the money to buy all her luxury goods.\\n“The sad reality at this point, it’s very hurtful to an independent woman like myself,” she said in a live stream in September, according to the Kami news portal. “Goddammit, I am so independent … I am so hardworking and I have pride in what I do.”\\nShe denied she was being a nepo-wife, saying how she hated the label because “your hard work is diminished, your hard work is all of a sudden nothing, just because you are now a mere political wife”.\\nFollowing the recent accusations against her, Evangelista has vowed to fight her critics. “I have been having meetings with my lawyer, and definitely I will not take it sitting down – what some people have been saying about me, not even allegedly,” she said, as quoted by the Inquirer.\\n",

            "title": "China-US trade truce offers certainty, relief for Hong Kong exporters",
            "description": "Hong Kong exporters breathed a collective sigh of relief following the recent breakthrough in Sino-US trade talks, saying they could now focus on their business plans for the coming year.\\nOn Thursday, Chinese President Xi Jinping and US counterpart Donald Trump reached a consensus to dial down tensions and put on hold a number of thorny issues such as pausing tariffs for a year until August next year.\\nWith the truce, a 10 per cent so-called reciprocal tariffs the United States imposed on imports from Hong Kong and mainland China will remain in effect until August.\\nAnthony Lam Sai-ho, chairman of the Federation of Hong Kong Industries, one of the largest business chambers in the city, said the meeting provided the sector with a clear picture of the tariff cost they should expect.\\n“Before that, they did not know how much they would be charged for the tariff when the goods were on the way amid the quarrel between the two countries,” he said.\\nHe urged the sector to explore and diversify their market in the coming year of the truce to further reduce reliance on the US market.\\n“The US is a market, but the world is huge. Could we manufacturers explore other markets, like China exporting many goods to Africa,” he said.\\nWingco Lo Kam-wing, president of the Chinese Manufacturers’ Association of Hong Kong, shared that local manufacturers finally felt some certainty following months of a roller-coaster ride on trade tensions.\\n“With the one-year truce, manufacturers can now make 2026 business plans with more confidence and flexibility,” he said, adding that he was not that worried about the mercurial nature of Trump as he had kept truce promises before.\\nHe expected manufacturers would shift some of their production lines back to the mainland over the next six months.\\nL&amp;A Lingerie, which produces luxurious underwear almost entirely from its factory in Guangdong province’s Huiyang, said the year-long truce eased her anxiety from looking for alternatives elsewhere to avoid the tariffs, according to director Karen Ng Pui-lam.\\nThe company was trying to reduce its reliance on the US market by tapping the European Union while shifting nearly 5 per cent of production to Vietnam in the past few months, she said.\\nThe US maintained 20 per cent “reciprocal tariffs” on Vietnam imports, higher than the 10 per cent tariffs on China.\\n“It was lucky that I did not invest a lot in Vietnam in hindsight,” she said.\\n\\nNg said that the company had to cut export prices by about 5 per cent, but its business remained stable and profitable so far this year on strong US demand.\\n“The trade truce brightens me and I can travel more for leisure again,” she said.\\nDanny Lau Tat-pong, honorary chairman of the Hong Kong Small and Medium Enterprises Association, said the meeting brought some certainty to the sector.\\n“If they really walk the talk, it means our industry could breathe a sigh of relief. But what happened next after this year and business could operate as usual? It is really hard to tell,” he said.\\nLau said some of the sensitive questions were not touched in the meeting such as the issue of Taiwan, South China Sea and the Philippines, which could easily spark a new round of quarrel between China and the US.\\nHe said half of the manufacturers having the production lines on the mainland already set up operations in Southeast Asia countries.\\n“We were reminded by our trade partners in the US some years before, they told us to set up some lines in Southeast Asia, or they could not place orders to us,” he said.\\nHe expected the trend of setting up production lines outside the mainland would continue to stave off geopolitical risks.\\nPui Kwan-kay, president of the Hong Kong Chinese Importers and Exporters Association, said his members were continuing their efforts to explore new markets such as the Middle East and South Asia.\\n“We could reference how changeable the Trump administration has been. So we won’t stop our exploration,” he said.\\n",
