            "title": "Angry Vietnam farmers take swing at Trump-branded US$1.5 billion golf resort",
            "description": "Five months after a glitzy groundbreaking ceremony just outside Hanoi, the area where The Trump Organisation-branded US$1.5 billion luxury golf resort was unveiled remains just fields of banana and orange trees as angry farmers challenge the site’s clearance plans.\\nThe project in Vietnam’s Hung Yen province is facing land recovery delays as residents contest the amount of compensation being offered by local authorities.\\nIt has been set at about 320,000 dong (US$12) per square metre (10 square feet) – equivalent to around one year’s income from the agricultural land for many of the farmers, plus rates that differ for varying plants and trees already there.\\n“It’s unreasonable that freshly planted crops can get a higher payment than trees that have been growing for 20 years,” said Do Thi Vung, who has spent more than 30 years cultivating land in the area. She is among hundreds of farmers who have petitioned authorities to at least double the compensation rate.\\n\\nThe resort, when finished, is set to feature five-star hotels, golf courses and residential estates spanning around 900 hectares (2,220 acres) along the Red River. The first phase is slated to be complete by late 2027, with the whole complex ready by 2029.\\nThe Trump Organisation’s Executive Vice-President Eric Trump said in May the project will “blow everybody away”.\\nUntil that can happen, however, Hung Yen officials need to hand over the land to the developer, Kinh Bac City Development Holding.\\nThe process has been held up not only because farmers are holding out but due to a huge government overhaul earlier this year that saw three tiers of local bureaucracy reduced to two.\\n“There are definitely delays,” said Le Trung Kien, an official in Chau Ninh, a commune in Hung Yen province. The work to clear the land was assigned in late June but stalled and only restarted in August, he said.\\nSource of friction\\nLand disputes are a long-standing source of social friction in Vietnam.\\nFarmers frequently complain that official compensation prices are set below market value, while the reclamation process can be open to corruption.\\nSuch grievances have occasionally erupted into protests – in one 2020 clash over land rights in Dong Tam commune, four people were killed.\\nThe government last year passed an amended land law aimed at narrowing the gap and improving transparency.\\nIn Hung Yen’s case, the province’s top administrators have ordered compensation plans be finalised by the end of October and 95 per cent of the land clearance be completed by the end of the year. But notices detailing payment amounts have only just been posted in some areas, triggering a 30-day period for public feedback.\\n\\nA representative of Hung Yen Provincial People’s Committee was not immediately available to comment.\\nIf disputes remain unresolved, the process could drag on with a discussion period of up to 60 days required to take place before compulsory land seizure can happen, according to Hoang Thi Oanh, a lawyer and director of Lion Law Firm.\\nSome 4 trillion dong has been earmarked for compensation and resettlement, according to a Hung Yen provincial news website.\\n“If people don’t agree, it will be very hard, even impossible, to achieve the target,” said Le Van Luong, the head of the project management board in Chau Ninh commune.\\nThe 320,000 dong per square metre payment has been calculated based on government regulations, he said. In Vietnam, land is collectively owned by the people and managed by the state, which grants land use rights in accordance with the law.\\nDang Thanh Tam, chairman of Kinh Bac City Development, said the developer had “received 100 hectares of land and expects the remaining 300 hectares for the first phase no later than January”.\\n“The inauguration of two VIP golf courses to welcome the Apec leader summit in November 2027 is completely feasible. The project is still on good schedule,” Tam said.\\nRepresentatives from The Trump Organisation did not respond to requests for comment.\\nPlanted evidence\\nComplicating matters, farmers are also now arguing about specific plants. Lilies appeared overnight in some places, residents said earlier this week, brought in from elsewhere and planted to add value for the official assessment.\\nThe approval process for the resort, which is a collaboration between Hung Yen Hospitality, a subsidiary of Kinh Bac City Development, and The Trump Organisation, took place as Vietnam’s government sought to stave off a threatened 46 per cent tariff on exports to the US – levies that were later reduced to 20 per cent.\\n\\nThe timeline was swift. After first being signed in September last year, the project received investment approval in May, with the launch ceremony taking place just a few days later.\\nStanding on a stage alongside Eric Trump at the event, Prime Minister Pham Minh Chinh pledged the government’s full backing and urged officials to actively support the project to have it ready in time for the Apec summit in late 2027.\\nThe Trump Organisation is set to receive US$5 million in licence fees for the project, according to a financial disclosure report released by the US Office of Government Ethics. It is not understood to be involved in the construction phase or compensation discussions.\\nFarmers unwilling to accept the offer can lodge a legal complaint. But as the rates are usually calculated and approved by authorities through an appraisal process in line with the law, their chances of securing a higher payment are slim, according to lawyer Oanh.\\nLives here had been “closely connected to the land for many years”, said Van Thi Thuan, head of Nam Mau village in the affected area. “Crops help raise the whole family,” she said.\\n“Farmers are willing to hand over the land for development though many will be jobless, many will struggle, but the compensation is too low for them.”\\n",

            "title": "North Korean denuclearisation ‘a pipe dream’, Pyongyang warns ahead of Seoul-Beijing talks",
            "description": "Hours before South Korea and China were set to hold their first summit, North Korea sought to set the tone by dismissing any discussion of its denuclearisation as a “pipe dream”.\\nChinese President Xi Jinping and South Korean President Lee Jae-myung are scheduled to hold their first face-to-face talks on Saturday on the sidelines of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit in the southeastern city of Gyeongju.\\nSeoul has said it hopes to raise the issue of North Korea’s denuclearisation during the meeting.\\nOn Saturday, North Korea’s Vice Foreign Minister Pak Myong-ho condemned the South for seeking to raise the topic whenever an opportunity arose.\\n“Denuclearisation is a ‘pipe dream’ which can never be realised even if it talks about it a thousand times,” Pak said in a statement carried by state media Korean Central News Agency.\\nSouth Korea still remained unaware that “struggling to deny the DPRK’s position as a nuclear weapons state and talking about its daydream of realising the denuclearisation just reveals its lack of common sense,” he added, using North Korea’s official name, the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea.\\n\\nAnalysts said the North’s statement appears aimed at deterring Seoul and Beijing from discussing denuclearisation at the summit, while also signalling a message to China.\\n“This statement is meant to prevent China and South Korea from discussing the denuclearisation issue as the most important topic at today’s summit,” Yang Moo-jin, a professor at the University of North Korean Studies, told This Week in Asia.\\nNoting that Pak was the vice foreign minister in charge of Asian and China affairs, he added: “It is also designed as a message targeting Beijing that it should avoid this topic at the summit.”\\nBeijing has traditionally emphasised three principles for peace on the Korean peninsula: denuclearisation, peace and the resolution of disputes through dialogue.\\nHowever, according to Yang, China appears to be shifting its emphasis away from denuclearisation towards the latter two principles.\\nThis move, he said, coincided with a deepening bloc-to-bloc confrontation between the United States and its allies on one side and Russia, China and North Korea on the other.\\n“South Korea wants to put the North’s denuclearisation high on the summit agenda, but China is expected to be selective in discussing it, raising instead the issue of the South seeking to build nuclear-propulsion submarines,” Yang said.\\n\\n\\nCho Han-bum, a senior researcher at the Korea Institute for National Unification, said Pyongyang was also “expressing its displeasure with President Xi visiting the South and sitting down with Lee for a summit”.\\nIn another apparent show of discontent, the North on Tuesday test-fired a “strategic” cruise missile in the Yellow Sea, shared with China, just hours before President Donald Trump arrived in South Korea during the final leg of his Asian trip, Cho noted.\\nIn May last year, North Korea denounced South Korea for reaffirming its commitment to the denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula in a joint declaration issued after a summit among the leaders of South Korea, China and Japan.\\nPyongyang rejected the trilateral summit’s call as a “blatant challenge” to its sovereign rights and “wanton interference” in its internal affairs.\\nNuclear sub approval\\nTrump said on Thursday he had given South Korea approval to build a nuclear-powered submarine at a Philadelphia shipyard operated by South Korea’s Hanwha Ocean.\\nChina’s foreign ministry the same day urged Seoul and Washington to uphold their nuclear non-proliferation obligations.\\n“China hopes that both South Korea and the US will practically implement their nuclear non-proliferation obligations, and take actions conducive to regional peace and stability, rather than doing the opposite,” Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Guo Jiakun said during a press briefing.\\nSouth Korea’s Chief of Naval Operations Kang Dong-gil told the National Assembly on Thursday that once a decision was made, it would take roughly 10 years to build a nuclear-powered submarine.\\nKang said the vessels would be 5,000 tonnes (5,500 tons) or larger, and the uranium enrichment level for the submarine’s fuel would remain at or below 20 per cent, reflecting its peaceful purpose.\\nUnder the Navy’s Changbogo-III (KSS-III) programme to acquire advanced diesel-electric attack submarines, South Korea has already commissioned three 3,000-tonne submarines for active duty.\\nThe country launched its first 3,600-tonne submarine last week.\\n\\nDefence Minister Ahn Gyu-back has said he believes South Korea should acquire four or more nuclear-powered submarines, adding that if Seoul builds them, it would have “huge military significance” in countering North Korea’s nuclear capabilities.\\nDespite Trump’s “political-level approval,” Yu Ji-hoon, a research fellow at the Korea Institute for Defence Analyses, said that “institutional, legal, technical, and diplomatic procedures and challenges still lie ahead”.\\nSouth Korea must first strengthen the perception in Washington that its nuclear-powered submarine programme serves US national interests, according to Yu.\\n“What’s important now is to broaden support among key figures in the US policy and defence circles,” he said.\\n",

            "title": "Chinese stocks: Investors study Beijing’s 5-year plan for hints on future market forces",
            "description": "Over the past week, investors hoping for an extension of this year’s blistering, tech-led run on Chinese equities have been poring over – and reading between the lines of – a draft of Beijing’s plan for economic and social development in the next five years.\\nThe blueprint emerged from a four-day Communist Party plenum that concluded on October 23, during which party chief Xi Jinping and the all-powerful Central Committee pledged to advance core technologies from semiconductors to artificial intelligence to quantum computing. They also highlighted tech self-reliance, domestic consumption and improving people’s livelihoods as key goals for 2026-2030.\\nThe Communist Party issued a summary of the development goals on the day the plenum ended, and a week later released the detailed proposal. While the five-year plan will not be finalised until the legislative National People’s Congress in March, the initial details are enough to reshape the investment landscape and help traders identify key medium-term opportunities.\\n“The five-year plan is expected to reset investment themes and the valuation system on the capital market,” said Wang Jun, a strategist at BOC International in Shanghai. “The new productive force represented by tech self-reliance, the green transition and an upgrade of domestic demand may run through the policy front and investment themes in the next five years. We expect long-term capital such as mutual funds and insurance funds to further tilt towards those industries of strategic value.”\\n\\nChipmakers, robotics companies, high-end manufacturers and stocks linked to domestic consumption were set to emerge as outperformers in the long run, according to brokerages including Guotai Haitong Securities and Huajin Securities.\\nIn a sign of how critical technology will be for China’s growth in the following five years, the proposal had 46 references to the word, compared with 36 in the plan for 2020-2025.\\nThe five-year plan’s importance for investors grew after this year’s bull run – which drove the Shanghai Composite Index of yuan-denominated stocks to a decade high – showed signs of petering out. A twist and turn in China-US tensions, frothy valuations of tech companies and a weak domestic economy threw the durability of the rally into doubt.\\nBeijing’s call for more tech breakthroughs and a renewed commitment to self-sufficiency should reignite enthusiasm for Chinese technology firms that have led the rally on the broader market this year, reversing years of declines. The surge in tech stocks stemmed from a re-rating triggered by the abrupt ascent of AI start-up DeepSeek earlier in the year and hopes of high-quality domestic products replacing imported products.\\n\\n\\nThe Star Market 50 index of the biggest stocks on the Shanghai exchange’s tech board, including Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corporation (SMIC) and AI chipmaker Cambricon Technologies, has gained 43 per cent this year. Meanwhile, the Hang Seng Tech Index has risen 32 per cent in the period. Both gauges have beaten the mainland and Hong Kong benchmarks.\\nSentiment this year also shifted towards Chinese tech stocks this year because Beijing ended a brutal regulatory crackdown on internet platforms that had sparked a massive exodus starting in 2020. Meanwhile, defying US curbs on exports of most advanced technologies, China is making rapid advances in the areas of robotics, AI infrastructure and large-language models as Beijing presses ahead with the self-reliance strategy.\\nThe stock market reflects the progress. The combined market capitalisation of strategic emerging industries totals 36 trillion yuan (US$5.1 trillion) currently, representing about 40 per cent of the aggregate value of the listed companies on the mainland’s three exchanges, according to Guosen Securities. Most of the companies were engaged in biopharmaceuticals, electronics and computing, it said.\\n“The bull run on tech stocks is expected to extend to 2026 or even the whole of the following five years,” said Wang Kai, an analyst at the brokerage. “The potential of Chinese tech stocks may lead global markets against the backdrop of innovation.”\\n\\n\\nGoldman Sachs said in an October 22 report that Chinese stocks could rise about 30 per cent through the end of 2027, with technology innovation sustaining earnings growth.\\nHowever, some observers were more cautious.\\nCharu Chanana, chief investment strategist at Saxo Markets, pointed to high valuations as a hindrance to further gains in Chinese tech stocks.\\nWhile the Hang Seng Tech Index was cheaper than the Nasdaq 100 on a price-to-earnings basis, its multiple of 20 times earnings was already close to the five-year average, according to Bloomberg data.\\nThe multiples for some leading companies are even more eye-watering. China’s biggest chipmaker, SMIC, was valued at 199 times estimated earnings for this year, and the ratio for Cambricon, dubbed China’s Nvidia, was 271 times, Bloomberg data showed. In comparison, the so-called Magnificent Seven US stocks, including Nvidia and Apple, currently trade at 38 times.\\n\\n\\n“In this context, policy optimism may already be priced in, leaving the next phase dependent on earnings delivery, particularly from domestic chipmakers, automation firms and AI infrastructure players capable of turning policy momentum into profits,” Chanana said.\\nUK-based asset management firm Aberdeen Investments said that it would explore opportunities arising from the green transition in the five-year plan, as it anticipated that China would double down on renewable energy.\\n“Renewable power investment is increasingly being used as a macro-stabilisation lever, which we estimate largely offset the drag from the real estate bubble being deflated over 2023 and 2024,” said Robert Gilhooly, an economist at Aberdeen. “Given the need to deal with overcapacity, we expect that power capacity, storage facilities and investment to integrate renewables into the grid will be ramped up.”\\n\\nOn top of tech innovation and self-reliance, the five-year proposal also emphasises maintaining a “reasonable” share of manufacturing in the economy, a strategy interpreted as entrenching China’s dominant position in the world’s supply chain amid geopolitical uncertainty.\\nBeijing has recently leveraged exports of rare earths – the critical metals used to make everything from weaponry to hi-tech products – in its trade talks with the US. China controls about 70 per cent of global supply and leads the world in refining and processing.\\nUnlike the preceding five-year plan through 2025, the new proposal devoted limited sections to the embattled property market and the ongoing anti-involution campaign that aims to eliminate obsolete capacity in some of the green-energy industries.\\nWhile this was a disappointment to investors who expected more policy support to alleviate these economic obstructions, Gary Dugan, CEO of The Global CIO Office, viewed the change in rhetoric as a decisive pivot to a new growth model that reduces reliance on real estate and credit.\\nWith China striving to pursue high-quality growth, key investment themes would emanate from deepening supply-side reforms, accelerating innovation in strategic sectors including semiconductors, AI and green energy, and enhancing the role of state-led investment in core infrastructure, he said.\\n“For markets, this suggests that cyclical reflation trades tied to property or broad-based stimulus will remain challenged, while targeted industrial sectors aligned with the new development plan, such as robotics, EVs and next-generation manufacturing, could continue to be the relative winners,” said Dugan, whose firm advises family offices, wealth managers and ultra-high-net-worth individuals.\\n\\nThe shift implied an annual growth rate of between 4.5 and 5 per cent in the next five-year period, compared with the current target of around 5 per cent, according to UBS Group. The Swiss bank added that China would need to strengthen the yuan and increase per capita gross domestic product by a compound annual rate of 6 to 8 per cent to meet its goal of matching developed countries in that metric by 2035.\\nFor those who bet on immediate stimulus measures, the plenum may present a short-term trading opportunity. Top leaders’ call for “resolutely” achieving this year’s economic growth target signalled a rapid ramp-up of policy support to arrest the resuming downturn, according to Nomura Holdings.\\nChina would require 4.2 per cent growth in the fourth quarter to meet its annual goal of around 5 per cent, but intensifying headwinds made reaching the target more challenging, said Lu Ting, chief China economist at the Japanese brokerage.\\nThe third quarter’s 4.8 per cent growth was mainly driven by the rising stock market and exports, which may not be sustainable, Lu said. More worrisome were a deceleration in retail sales, a decline in fixed-asset investment and the unrelenting slump in the property market, he added. Supportive measures put in place earlier, including childbirth subsidies and an increase in bond issuances by local governments, were not adequate to reverse course, he said.\\n“We reckon that after the plenum, policy focus might be once again shifted to ensuring short-term growth stability and ending deflation,” Lu said. “Fiscal expansion will likely be stepped up, policy rates could be moderately cut and arrears might be further cleared.”\\nAn easing of the China-US confrontation after the meeting between President Xi Jinping and US President Donald Trump this week may only underscore the urgency of tech innovation and self-efficiency for Beijing, as both sides are buying time for a potential decoupling. Washington signed a slew of pacts with Australia and Japan recently on rare earth access, as it aims to wean itself from reliance on China for the metals.\\nThe Xi-Trump sit-down provided “both sides with time to adapt to this evolving dynamic, reduce mutual dependencies and mitigate economic disruption”, said Sophie Altermatt, an economist at Julius Baer, the Switzerland-based financial institution that specialises in private banking and wealth management.\\n\\nHistorically, China’s stock markets react positively to the release of five-year development plans. The mainland’s yuan-traded stocks rose by an average of 16.5 per cent one year after the plenums, while key industries seen as policy beneficiaries returned 17.5 per cent on average, according to HSBC Qianhai Securities.\\nThe brokerage recommended that investors focus on stocks associated with tech innovation, consumption and the green transition.\\nThe five-year plan would “strengthen the trend of a slow bull market in the longer perspective,” said Deng Lijun, an analyst at Huajin Securities.\\n“Earnings expectations will continue to improve, and proactive policies will expand stocks’ valuations,” he said. “Risk appetite will get a boost.”\\n",

            "title": "Hong Kong’s superyacht economy must not leave city’s poor in its wake",
            "description": "With over 12,000 registered yachts but only around 4,300 berths, Hong Kong plans to boost its yacht tourism by adding about 1,100 berths at several locations: the proposed Airport Bay Marina, the Hung Hom harbourfront, the former Lamma Quarry and the expanded Aberdeen Typhoon Shelter.\\nThe projects are part of the city’s waterfront developments. Airport Bay Marina, for instance, was revealed in the Skytopia master plan, which includes an expanded AsiaWorld-Expo, a “jet fresh market” designed to rival Tokyo’s Tsukiji Fish Market, and an art storage hub. The proposed Hung Hom waterfront development, meanwhile, plans to integrate the Hung Hom MTR station, Hong Kong Coliseum and harbourfront into a new retail and entertainment destination.\\nThis would revitalise underused land and could provide a crucial link between Tsim Sha Tsui promenade to the west, the future “Victoria Cove area” at To Kwa Wan and the Kai Tak Sports Park to the east.\\nFor Hong Kong, a city with nearly 1,200km of coastline, hundreds of islands and an iconic deepwater harbour at the southern tip of the Greater Bay Area, it makes sense to enhance its waterfront and yacht tourism.\\nThe Business and Professionals Alliance for Hong Kong says the yacht industry could generate HK$4.5 billion (US$579 million) annually. This would be a tiny fraction of Hong Kong’s economy, which exceeded US$407 billion last year. But if the yacht industry is the bone, the meat on it would be the assets and investments brought in by the oligarchs and high-net-worth individuals – a fast-growing class on the mainland – attracted by the new marinas, if these marinas are sufficiently well designed, implemented and operated.\\nHong Kong has been aggressively strengthening its position as a global wealth management hub. With its expensive real estate, favourable tax rates with no capital gains or dividend tax, and now planned marinas for superyachts, is the city becoming China’s Monaco?\\n\\nPromoted as the world’s capital of luxury yachting, Monaco attracts over 40 per cent of all superyachts and the industry contributes to the port city’s economy through design, manufacturing, sales and management. Major industry events held there include the World Yachting Summit and Monaco Yacht Show, where the wealthiest brush shoulders with one another and discuss their new toys while yacht makers compare their latest offerings. It is no surprise an estimated one-third of Monaco’s residents are millionaires or billionaires, making it one of the world’s wealthiest states.\\nBut the reality might be less than rosy. Out of a population of about 38,500, according to an official census last year, less than a quarter were native Monegasques – most residents came from surrounding countries including France, Italy, Britain and Germany. Ultra-wealthy people are attracted to the city and its favourable tax conditions, including Formula One driver Lewis Hamilton and tennis star Novak Djokovic. With no personal income tax, the authorities in Monaco have no procedures with which to track its poverty rates: officially the city state has no poverty to declare.\\nCan a city really have no poor people? It sounds utopian – but it also implies there is no accommodation for anyone who cannot afford to live there.\\nAs we develop our marinas and yacht tourism, we should ask ourselves what kind of city Hong Kong aspires to be. The Monaco model, for lack of a better description, is a billionaires’ club: those who neither qualify nor fit in are dismissed. While we want to attract wealth to Hong Kong, we cannot lose sight of our social mandate to lift the grass roots and working class.\\nWe are failing miserably in addressing the city’s wealth gap. According to Oxfam Hong Kong’s report last year, almost 23 per cent of households still live in poverty and the wealthiest 10 per cent of households had a median monthly income 82 times that of the poorest 10 per cent. This is shameful.\\n\\n\\nWith close to 200 times the population of Monaco, Hong Kong has many layers of constituents to consider when formulating and implementing its policies. If we truly want to build an inclusive society, we do not need fancy slogans. Instead, we should consider devoting as many resources to our struggling classes as we channel in funding to build our shiny new infrastructure – whether for museums, stadiums, a private jet terminal, an airport city or, in this case, superyacht marinas.\\nA comprehensive approach towards both ends of society would narrow Hong Kong’s wealth gap as we improve the quality of life for most, rather than the few. Otherwise, we risk finding everything from housing to services increasingly unaffordable, spiralling into a vicious circle where commoners and the underprivileged have no opportunity to climb the ladder at all.\\nAmazon founder Jeff Bezos famously dismissed the idea of achieving work-life balance, calling it “debilitating” as it implies a trade-off between work and leisure. Instead, he advocates for work-life harmony: for different pieces of the puzzle to work in sync, enhancing and reinforcing one another.\\nTo borrow from one of the world’s most famous billionaires, harmony is not a zero-sum game where one’s win implies another’s loss. Most of us do not own a yacht. We know the berths are not for us. But we understand the city needs growth and new economic drivers. As long as policymakers allocate equal time and resources for the other end of society, we can create a stronger, healthier and more harmonious society for all.\\n",

            "description": "Chinese observers downplayed Beijing’s reference to Okinawans as “indigenous”, saying the comments were primarily a critique of the militarisation of Japan’s southernmost prefecture – home to dozens of US military bases – rather than a challenge to Tokyo’s sovereignty over Okinawa.\\nOn October 9, China’s deputy permanent representative to the United Nations, Sun Lei, urged Japan to “stop prejudice and discrimination against Okinawans and other indigenous peoples”.\\nSun made the remarks during a general debate meeting of the Third Committee, the United Nations General Assembly’s principal human rights committee. During the meeting, Sun commented on human rights issues and raised concerns over several countries including Japan.\\nOkinawa lies on a fault line in Sino-Japanese ties and regional politics. The prefecture governs the Japanese-controlled Diaoyu Islands, known as the Senkaku Islands in Japan, which are at the centre of a long-standing territorial dispute between Beijing and Tokyo.\\nThe Ainu in northern Japan are the only group officially recognised as indigenous people by Tokyo.\\nAccording to a Chinese statement, Sun told the UN meeting: “China urged Japan to confront the history of its militaristic aggression against neighbouring Asian countries and colonial rule during World War II … [and to] genuinely improve the social status of women and end prejudice and discrimination against Okinawans and other indigenous peoples.”\\nSun’s remarks were picked up by media last month. A Japanese report, citing a Ryukoku University professor, said the statement suggested “a shift in Beijing’s recognition” of Okinawa that could affect US military bases and potentially support the prefecture’s autonomy.\\nSome have speculated that Beijing could try to challenge Japan’s control over Okinawa, which was once known as the kingdom of Ryukyu. The ancient kingdom was a Chinese tributary state in the East China Sea for more than 500 years until it was annexed by Japan in 1879.\\nOkinawa is strategically located just 110 km (68 miles) east of Taiwan and has a heavy American military presence, making it vital in the event of a conflict between China and the US.\\n\\n\\nZheng Zhihua, an associate professor at Shanghai Jiao Tong University, said Sun’s recent remarks should not be overinterpreted.\\nThe comments were brief and “quite restrained” and should be understood in the broader context of opposing excessive militarisation and advocating respect for local communities’ rights, according to Zheng.\\n“As competition between China and the US has intensified, Okinawa’s military significance has once again become prominent. In particular, US actions over Taiwan issues over the past two years have heightened Okinawa’s strategic importance,” he said.\\n“China’s intention is to express that Okinawa should not again become a military fortress but return to being a hub of peace and trade in East Asia, as it once was historically,” said Zheng, who heads the East Asia Marine Policy Project at the university’s Centre for Japanese Studies.\\nTrade and exchanges between Ryukyu and China flourished from the 14th century onwards, and the kingdom became a tributary state to the Ming dynasty (1368-1644). But Japanese influence grew in subsequent centuries before Ryukyu was annexed by Japan in 1879 and became Okinawa prefecture.\\nIn 2023, Chinese President Xi Jinping raised eyebrows when he referred to Okinawa prefecture as Ryukyu, discussing the kingdom’s links to southeastern China’s Fujian province.\\nAlthough Okinawa’s governor Denny Tamaki welcomed the comments as evidence of Xi’s willingness to develop ties with the Ryukyu Islands, some Japanese media outlets expressed concern, saying it showed that China might play up the issue of Okinawa’s sovereignty in the future.\\nWang Guangtao, deputy director of the Centre for Japanese Studies at Fudan University in Shanghai, noted that pro-autonomy groups in Okinawa had long sought recognition from the UN, and Sun’s reference to Okinawans as indigenous reflected awareness of these advocacy efforts.\\nBut Beijing’s official stance would remain cautious and consistent, Wang said.\\n“Okinawa is still under Japan’s claim as a prefecture within its sovereign territory. From the perspective of the Chinese government, if Japan doesn’t cross any red lines on Taiwan issues, China’s stance on the issue would not be too extreme.”\\nWhen Beijing and Tokyo established diplomatic ties in 1972, they agreed to mutually respect sovereignty and territorial integrity, and Beijing has never officially questioned Japan’s rule over Okinawa.\\nAfter Japan surrendered in September 1945, ending World War II, the Ryukyu Islands were placed under US control. That continued until 1972, when the US – concerned about the spread of communism in Asia – transferred its control of the islands to Japan on condition that the US retain its military bases there.\\nOkinawa is home to 1.4 million people. It also hosts 32 US military bases, including Kadena Air Base – the largest US military installation in the Asia-Pacific region and home to the largest wing in the US Air Force. Some 30,000 US service members are based in Okinawa, along with 50,000 civilian employees and family members, according to US military sources.\\n",

            "title": "National Games success is ‘missing piece’ for Hong Kong fencing boss",
            "description": "The man overseeing the development of fencing in Hong Kong has said he is targeting gold medals for some of his charges at this month’s National Games – but refused to reveal the number he has in mind.\\nZheng Kangzhao, the city’s head coach, said the current crop of fencers in all three weapon categories – foil, épée and sabre – were better placed to triumph than their predecessors.\\nSpearheading the challenge will be two-time Olympic champion Cheung Ka-long and his fellow foilist Ryan Choi Chun-yin, the reigning world champion.\\nAnd they will take to the piste in familiar surroundings, with Hong Kong’s Kai Tak Arena staging the fencing events from November 15 to 20 as the city co-hosts the Games alongside Guangdong and Macau.\\n\\n“It’s on my wish list [to win golds], and we are playing at home,” said Zheng, who has been in charge for 14½ years. “It’s a grand slam [opportunity] for us … we have won everything we could internationally. The China Games was the only missing piece, so that’s my wish.”\\nHe said focusing on process would yield the desired results.\\n“I haven’t discussed with [Cheung or Choi] about winning medals,” Zheng said. “I just want them to enjoy the Games. Do you think they don’t want to win?\\n“We cannot be too greedy. Sometimes, having too many demands and desires can become a source of pressure. I have a number in mind, but I am not saying it.\\n“I didn’t even tell any of my coaches; I didn’t tell them what they should do. More often, I said, ‘If you train well, plan well, manage the athletes well and handle the process well, the results will follow naturally.’\\n“Our men’s foil, both individual and the team, have chances. For the other weapons, we have chances, but it’s not [a given]. It depends on our performance on the day.”\\nThe foilists, except Cheung, and the sabreists will first take part in World Cup legs in Spain and Algeria next week before returning home to prepare for the quadrennial Games.\\nThe épéeists had been scheduled to travel too, to the United Arab Emirates for another World Cup meet, but that event has been rescheduled to January.\\nZheng said overseas competitions remained a necessary focus even with a multisport extravaganza approaching at home.\\n“The international competitions remain our targets, and the National Games is only icing on the cake for us,” he said. “My yearly plan was always about the international season, and we didn’t even train specifically for the National Games.\\n“So we must focus on the international tournaments, because that’s what keeps our rankings. We always want to take part in as many tournaments overseas as possible … our main battlefield was not an internal war but those international competitions.”\\nHong Kong’s fencers will be allowed to practise at Kai Tak’s 10,000-seat arena on November 12 before it is closed for final preparations. After that, their task will be to turn the venue to their advantage.\\n“Everything is a double-edged sword – the water that keeps a ship afloat can also sink it,” Zheng said. “It’s only about your mindset.\\n“If you see [being at home] as motivation, then you’ll get excited. When you see it as pressure, you then carry that burden yourself.”\\nHong Kong’s previous appearances at the Games have produced one silver and five bronze medals in fencing between 2013 and 2021.\\nVivian Kong Man-wai, who retired after claiming Olympic gold last year, was the last to win an individual medal, pocketing épée bronze in Shaanxi four years ago. The men’s foilists have been the only Hong Kong team to reach the podium, collecting bronze in 2017 and 2021.\\n",

            "description": "Inside the cramped premises of Hong Kong Family Food, a two-dish-rice restaurant in Causeway Bay, 59-year-old Lo Hung-wan toils away serving up takeaway meals for her customers.\\n“It is very busy during the lunch rush; I won’t even bother to answer the phone during this period,” said Lo, one of the restaurant’s operators. “During those couple of hours, it feels like we are fighting a war.”\\nTwo-dish rice is a type of meal that allows diners to select two pre-cooked main dishes of their choice accompanied by a generous serving of rice – all for around HK$30 (US$3.70) or more.\\n\\nThe format became popular in Hong Kong during the Covid-19 pandemic when many residents turned to the cheaper takeaway option after the government banned restaurant dining after 6pm for more than four months.\\nIndustry insiders estimate that the number of such eateries has mushroomed from around 300 during the pandemic to roughly 1,000 in the city now, ramping up competition among them.\\nHong Kong Family Food, which downsized from a pandemic peak of three branches to only one, knows this all too well.\\nLo said that increased competition from other two-dish-rice restaurants was one of the reasons they closed their branches, along with changing consumption patterns and rising costs.\\n\\n\\nWhile the remaining branch in Causeway Bay made enough to break even, it was still facing headwinds with rising costs, strong rivalry from similar stores nearby and uncertainty about where future customers would come from, Lo said.\\nTo better compete and retain customers, Lo publishes an online menu of the meals they will prepare for the month to allow customers to place advance orders online and to promote seasonal dishes – such as lamb and glutinous rice in winter – to attract diners.\\nLo is not alone with her business struggle. Earlier, This This Rice, a two-dish rice chain which used to run 10 outlets at its peak, shut around half of them.\\nIn July, its outlet in Causeway Bay’s Jardine’s Bazaar and its company secretary were also sued by its landlord for at least HK$533,430, which represented three months’ worth of unpaid rent, rates and interest.\\nSimon Wong Ka-wo, president of the Hong Kong Federation of Restaurants and Related Trades, said that the competition among two-dish-rice restaurants had increased with the influx of such eateries to the market in recent years.\\nHe attributed their rise to factors such as cheaper rent following the pandemic, the simplicity of setting up these eateries and the ease of expansion through franchising.\\n\\nHowever, Wong said he did not believe that the market was oversaturated with these restaurants. Instead, the market was currently undergoing consolidation, under which weaker businesses would be weeded out while stronger ones remained, he said.\\n“With the appearance of two-dish-rice restaurants in every district, I may see one street that will have two to three two-dish-rice restaurants. This shows that there is heavy competition,” he said.\\n“If the person beside you does better than you, then you will lose. If you keep losing money like this, then it will be hard for you to keep operating.”\\nWong suggested that if operators wanted to keep their businesses afloat, they would have to come up with different ideas to help set them apart from others.\\n“For instance, everyone is talking about health these days,” he said. “If operators provided healthy alternatives, they may have another market to attract customers who are health-conscious.”\\n",

            "description": "An 11-year-old boy who accidentally swallowed a 10-gram gold bean worth 10,000 yuan (US$1,400) by mistake was told by his mother not to relieve himself outside because it would be “too expensive”.\\nThe story has amused many people on mainland social media, where it quickly went viral.\\nThe incident unfolded in Kunshan, Jiangsu province, southeastern China, after a woman surnamed Ji bought the 10-gram gold bean on October 17.\\nWith gold prices surging more than 50 per cent this year to more than US$4,000 an ounce, many Chinese people regard it as the most stable and reliable asset, especially in light of weaker stock and property markets.\\n\\nOn October 22, shortly after the gold bean was delivered, Ji’s son started playing with it.\\nWhile Ji was busy washing clothes on the balcony, the boy rushed over and told her: “Mum, hurry up, I am going to die. I swallowed the gold.”\\nHe added that he had done so after trying “to exercise the strength of his tongue”.\\nAt first, Ji thought he was joking. But after confirming the gold bean was indeed gone, she was both amused and worried.\\nHowever, she did not want to handle the predicament at home.\\n“My niece once swallowed a coin,” Ji told the Dawan News.\\n\\n“When we took her to the hospital, the doctor said it was not a big deal and that she would pass it in her stool. So when this happened, I looked it up and saw that gold can also be passed the same way, so I did not take it too seriously,” she added.\\nHoping to recover the “lost treasure”, every day Ji told her son not to relieve himself outside because his “poop is too expensive”.\\nHowever, even after five consecutive days of checking his faeces twice daily, she still could not find the gold.\\nOn October 26, Ji took her son to the Fifth People’s Hospital in Kunshan.\\nAn examination found a “foreign object in the stomach”, but fortunately, the boy showed no signs of abdominal pain or vomiting.\\nLater the same day, the gold was successfully retrieved. It is unclear whether it was expelled naturally or through medical intervention.\\n\\n“Please make sure to store your gold properly and never let naughty children see it,” the mother warned.\\nAfter the relieved mother shared the details online, the story quickly went viral, attracted more than 500,000 views and caused much amusement.\\nOne online observer said: “They should have gone to the hospital immediately. They actually waited five whole days? That is unbelievably careless.”\\nWhile another person joked: “That is one gold bean with a scent.”\\n",

            "title": "Thai vendors go in the red to sell mourning clothes: ‘my time to pay back’",
            "description": "In a bustling Bangkok market, hundreds of wholesale vendors have been selling black clothing since dawn – several with hefty discounts – in honour of Thailand’s late former queen.\\nRows of black T-shirts at a small stall hang near a banner reading “black shirts 40 baht” – a fraction of the usual price of 200 to 500 baht (US$6 to US$15) – drawing a steady stream of shoppers.\\n“We sell at this price so all Thais can wear black to pay respect to the queen mother,” said the business’s owner, Thanachote Siripadungdech, who launched the promotion shortly after the palace announced former queen Sirikit’s death.\\nSirikit, the mother of King Maha Vajiralongkorn, died on Friday last week at the age of 93.\\n\\nThe royal family holds a central place in Thai society, with portraits of its members seen in homes, offices and public spaces across the country.\\nSince Sirikit’s death, the government has declared a year-long mourning period for officials and urged the public to wear traditional Thai mourning colours of black or white for 90 days.\\nThe commerce ministry also has warned businesses against price gouging and set up a hotline for complaints.\\nSome clothing stores in shopping malls and wholesale vendors have switched their stock to sombre hues, seeking to capitalise on the nation’s grief.\\nBut Thanachote, 53, said he had lost a significant sum in the past week by selling shirts at least 100 baht a piece below cost.\\n“I am stable in life now and I have no debts so selling at a loss is fine by me,” he said.\\n“I just want to do something for the queen mother and the royal family,” added the vendor, dressed head to toe in black while fielding calls from suppliers in Thailand and China.\\n“They had worked so hard for Thailand. Now it’s my time to pay back.”\\n\\n\\nThanachote said he was giving away 200 shirts to senior citizens and low-income families.\\nNupap Khiaochaiyaphum, a 57-year-old farmer from northeastern Khon Kaen province, said she was grateful for the two free black polo shirts she got from his stall.\\n“I have black shirts back in my hometown, but not here [in Bangkok],” she said. “I love the monarchy so I will wear this to mourn the queen mother.”\\n‘Institutional observance’\\nAt another stall nearby, vendor Anut Pormsri and his assistant sat scrolling on their phones beneath a sign offering two black shirts for 100 baht.\\nHe said sales have plummeted compared to past royal mourning periods. “I used to sell a lot more. Now I am selling at a loss and hardly get any customers.”\\nHe said the low prices were both “a tribute and a clearance [discount]“ on a large backstock of black shirts emblazoned with the Thai character for number nine which were made to mourn the late king Bhumibol Adulyadej, known as “Rama IX”.\\n\\nWhen Bhumibol, King Vajiralongkorn’s father and one of the world’s longest-reigning monarchs, died in 2016, the country observed a full year of mourning.\\nAt another stall, shop worker Chit Sopheak was selling shirts in various colours, including black, at regular prices, starting from 199 baht.\\nHe also said sales had dropped this year, and had recently only sold around 50 shirts a day, compared to up to 400 daily during the previous royal mourning period.\\n“There is competition from online vendors,” he said. “The economy also isn’t good now.”\\nAnalyst Pavin Chachavalpongpun, a former Thai diplomat and academic who studies the monarchy, noted a difference between the public mourning for Sirikit and the grief expressed for the late king, calling it “the clearest measure of how drastically Thailand’s political landscape has shifted”.\\n\\n“Older generations and state employees maintain dutiful compliance – observing government mandates for black attire and periods of official grief,” he said.\\nBut the national mood in the past week has reflected “institutional observance” more than “organic, profound sorrow”, according to Pavin.\\nSome vendors said their discounts were meant to express their personal appreciation and respect for the royal family.\\n“I am thankful to be born in their majesties’ era,” said Thanachote. “I wasn’t born rich, but this kingdom gave me the chance to prosper.”\\n",
