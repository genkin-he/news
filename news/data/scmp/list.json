            "description": "JD.com is making a renewed push into its online supermarket business with a subsidy programme worth more than 20 billion yuan (US$2.9 billion) over three years, a move aimed at defending its position in China’s e-commerce and on-demand grocery sectors.\nIn a statement on Thursday, JD.com said the subsidy would cover products on a dedicated channel called “Billion-Yuan Supermarket”, under its JD Supermarket service. The aim was to help vendors generate an additional 200 billion yuan in sales over the next three years.\nThe move underscored a “strong defensive” strategy from JD.com directed at rivals such as Meituan, Pinduoduo and Alibaba Group Holding as they expand into each other’s territory, according to Li Chengdong, founder and chief analyst at e-commerce consultancy Dolphin Think Tank.\nAlibaba owns the South China Morning Post.\nAfter Alibaba bolstered its efforts in the online food delivery market, JD.com expanded into the sector with a 10 billion yuan subsidy programme last year. Meanwhile, Meituan, which dominates the market, was making a bigger push into the country’s growing on-demand grocery market.\n\n“JD.com’s push into online food delivery costs them some losses, so they might as well subsidise their grocery business,” Li said.\nJD.com’s strategy over the past decade was to shift its focus from computers, communications and consumer electronics – products that got it started – to “fast-moving consumer goods” which require frequent replenishments, said Li.\nThe shift led the company to acquire on-demand delivery platform Dada Nexus as well as invest in bricks-and-mortar retail chains, including its own 7 Fresh, to double down on the on-demand sector. This was a booming arena in which Chinese “big tech” companies from Alibaba to Meituan were competing to secure a bigger slice of the pie, he added.\nJD.com said on Thursday that the scale of the subsidy would make the Billion-Yuan Supermarket its largest subsidised product category, surpassing electronics.\nJD Supermarket has experienced rapid growth, with the growth rate of users and orders exceeding 20 per cent in 2025, the company said, without revealing specific figures.\nThe company said last year that it aimed to boost the number of users of the service from 300 million to 500 million over the next three years.\n",

            "title": "Hong Kong banks’ collateral asset valuations to continue declining in 2026: S&P",
            "description": "The value of collateral assets used by banks for commercial property loans is expected to continue declining in 2026, according to S&amp;P Global Ratings, as the sector has yet to find a clear bottom.\n“More collateral pain is likely this year for Hong Kong banks,” the credit rating agency said in a report published on Thursday, adding that a subset of small banks could face more acute strain.\nThat assessment comes as Hong Kong’s commercial property market remains on a sustained downturn that started in 2019, as rents continue to fall and vacancy rates soar.\nThe Bank of East Asia, Hong Kong’s sixth-largest bank by total assets, recently disclosed a HK$723 million (US$92.4 million) valuation loss in its total investment properties in 2025, rising sharply from HK$145 million in 2024.\nThat illustrated the ongoing pressure on collateral valuations, according to S&amp;P.\nThe ratings firm tested two stress scenarios: a 30 per cent discount to collateral and a worst-case scenario of a 50 per cent discount. The second scenario was based on recent sales of commercial properties in the secondary market, where owners sold them at around 50 per cent less than what they originally paid.\nBanks may be forced to dispose of collateral, especially non-prime assets, at steep discounts that exceed market average valuation, according to the report.\nSince the secondary market was not very transparent, it also remained difficult to track such risks in real time, it added.\nUnder a 50 per cent discount to collateral value, the return on average asset – a key gauge of profitability for banks – could fall to 0.58 per cent from 0.81 per cent in a base case. Their non-performing loan ratio could also grow to 4.3 per cent from 2.9 per cent.\n\nAlthough the slide in collateral asset valuations appeared to ease in recent months, the market could continue to weaken for a while, according to the S&amp;P report.\nSince late 2025, office and retail rents have fallen about 1 per cent and 2 per cent, respectively. That was less severe than the situation in 2024, when office and retail leases were down 5 per cent and 7 per cent, respectively.\nAccording to a report this week from Sam Gourlay, JLL’s head of office leasing advisory on Hong Kong Island, leasing demand in core areas such as Central was returning, primarily driven by financial institutions.\nStill, plenty of office space remained available, the report said, adding that retailers faced strong competition, including from cross-border options.\nPersistent oversupply and elevated vacancy rates were expected to continue exerting downward pressure on rental levels across Hong Kong’s grade A office market, according to property experts.\n“Based on our scenario analysis, the capitalisation of the Hong Kong banking system as a whole would remain resilient even under severe valuation shocks,” said S&amp;P credit analyst Phyllis Liu, adding that the impact was unlikely to materially weaken the sector’s capitalisation and trigger any systemic risk.\n“Many banks have cut exposure to commercial real estate in the past five years, thus limiting the impact of losses in this segment,” Liu said. “They also have solid earnings and excess capital to absorb potential losses.”\nSuch resilience, however, remains uneven. The report said large banks were best positioned to absorb stress.\nBut a subset of small banks with high exposure to non-prime commercial properties, weaker earnings buffers and aggressive risk appetite were vulnerable to risks such as stressed liquidity conditions or economic downturns, according to S&amp;P.\nSome small banks also have larger-than-average capital cushions, which would protect them against weaker earnings capacity, the report said. As a group, they would still be profitable under both stress scenarios, it added.\n",

            "description": "Semiconductor designer Hygon Information Technology and supercomputer maker Sugon, two stalwarts of China’s tech self-reliance efforts, reported surging revenue for 2025 amid strong domestic demand for home-grown computing systems.\nThe two Shanghai-listed companies’ latest financial results reflect a broader trend across China’s public and private sectors to increase engagement with domestic technology suppliers, as artificial intelligence development projects in the country intensified.\nHeadquartered in Beijing, Hygon posted revenue of 14.4 billion yuan (US$2.1 billion) last year, a 56.9 per cent jump from 2024. Profit attributable to shareholders reached 2.54 billion yuan, up 32 per cent from a year earlier.\nHygon attributed the hefty sales growth to the “continued rise in demand for domestically produced high-end chips”. The company said its market share in high-end processors expanded amid cooperation with original equipment manufacturers and other partners in key industries and fields.\nThe firm expected even faster growth – between 62.9 per cent and 75.8 per cent – this first quarter, driven by increased investment in research and development due to “demand from the AI industry”.\n\nSugon, which makes high-performance computing systems and is the largest shareholder of Hygon, posted a 13.9 per cent year-on-year increase in revenue to 14.97 billion yuan last year. Its net profit rose 10.5 per cent to 2.11 billion yuan.\nThe strong performance of Hygon and Sugon also indicated the urgency in China to strengthen support for its domestic supply chain, as US tech restrictions and geopolitical tensions continue to affect the country’s technology sector.\nDespite major demand from Chinese AI companies, imports of Nvidia’s H200 graphics processing units into the country remain in limbo.\nChina, meanwhile, has continued to invest massive resources to build computing capacity amid a heated AI arms race with the US. In the five years to June 2025, the number of gigabit broadband users in the country grew 34-fold to 226 million, substantially lifting the country’s computing power demand.\nIn December, Hygon and Sugon called off plans for a mega-merger after months of talks, citing how “the market environment has changed significantly since the initial planning stages of this transaction”.\nThey said the factors affecting their respective stocks included “changes in the domestic and international environment, the overall trend of the mainland share market, changes in the artificial intelligence industry’s popularity and market expectations” .\nThe aborted merger dashed industry expectations that consolidating the assets of Sugon and Hygon would create a major domestic ecosystem covering advanced processors and high-performance servers.\n",

            "description": "Hong Kong’s decision to end tax breaks for private electric cars has sparked a rush to the showrooms, with some residents even selling their eligibility for the incentive scheme.\nA car dealer told the South China Morning Post on Thursday that sales had surged by a factor of 17, adding that one customer broke into tears just after midnight, fearing he had missed the registration deadline.\n“Last night there were many people … there was a queue at one point,” said Eric Wong Ngai-lik, chairman of Richburg Corporation, the Hong Kong dealer for electric vehicle (EV) brands MG and GAC Aion.\n“One customer arrived at our showroom after midnight and became very emotional, thinking he was no longer eligible. But the issue was resolved after we explained he would still qualify as long as he bought an in-stock vehicle before March 31.”\nFinancial Secretary Paul Chan Mo-po announced in his budget address on Wednesday that from April 1, the government will scrap first registration tax (FRT) concessions for private electric cars, including the “One-for-One Replacement Scheme”.\nThe scheme offers car owners a higher FRT concession of up to HK$172,500 (US$22,056) when they scrap and deregister an eligible older private car in exchange for a new electric car purchase.\nWong said sales had surged seventeenfold across his 12 stores on Wednesday, jumping from an average of 20 cars a day to about 340 by the evening.\nHe noted that many customers were confused about when the concessions would expire and feared that buying an EV after Wednesday night would make them ineligible.\n“Our staff only got off work at 3am,” he added.\nWong said the surge in customers was driven by “unclear information” released to the public about how the scheme would wind down.\n“To put it simply, the instructions are quite complicated and could be much clearer,” he said. “You shouldn’t put out a long block of text and expect the public to guess what it means.”\nUnder the government policy, buyers can still buy from available stock before March 31 to be eligible for the concession.\nBut orders for cars arriving later should have been placed on or before February 25, the day of the budget announcement, with applications submitted no later than February 24, 2027.\nSome car owners turned to social media after the budget announcement, offering to sell their eligibility for the tax breaks – either stand-alone or bundled with an older private car – for HK$25,000 to HK$60,000.\nOthers complained the prices for these “quotas,” as they are known locally, were unreasonably high.\n“[People] on Facebook are raising prices to HK$40,000 or HK$50,000,’ one user said.\nA Facebook group dedicated to the replacement scheme now has about 950 members.\nHowever, an industry leader warned that this option was not without risks and predicted a 40 per cent drop in sales in the months after the scheme ends on March 31.\nRingo Lee Yiu-pui, governor and honorary life president of the Hong Kong, China Automobile Association, said it was risky to buy a car just for the purpose of getting the tax break.\nA car seller would need to help transfer ownership to the new EV buyer, Lee said, adding: “If problems arise, it could be troublesome, and you’ve already paid for the ‘quota’.”\nThe industry is predicting a 40 per cent drop in EV sales once the tax breaks end.\n“Maybe after four to five months, [we can] check the electric vehicle prices offered by car factories, whether there would be a huge price cut. Most of us aren’t very optimistic about this year,” Lee said, adding that any price drop would depend on whether car manufacturers were confident about Hong Kong’s market.\nThe FRT concession for electric commercial vehicles, electric motorcycles and electric motor tricycles will remain fully waived until the end of March 2028.\n",

            "description": "A proposed high-level committee that will focus on artificial intelligence (AI) could help tech start-ups in Hong Kong mitigate legal and geopolitical challenges, as well as gain access to important databases for model training, market leaders have said.\nBut the experts also told the South China Morning Post on Thursday that the committee, which was proposed in the latest budget and will be led by the city’s finance chief, would need to involve a diverse panel of experts and be “action-driven” to adapt quickly to the fast-shifting industry.\nLawmaker William Wong Kam-fai, who is also a professor of computational linguistics, said he expected the committee would “break down walls” and speed up funding approval processes, delivering faster support to the sector.\n“AI companies in Hong Kong will need much more computing power and better algorithms to handle big data effectively,” he said. “For example, more companies could be allowed to use supercomputing centres.”\nWong was referring to the Cyberport’s own supercomputing centre, which launched in December 2024.\n\n\n\n\nIn Financial Secretary Paul Chan Mo-po’s budget speech on Wednesday, he pledged to establish and chair the “Committee on AI+ and Industry Development Strategy”, which would devise strategies and create favourable conditions for industrial transformation.\nThe committee will include academics and other experts, as well as representatives from enterprises and industry park companies.\nIt will initially focus on life and health technologies and “embodied AI”, a concept that involves AI embedded in physical systems such as robots or devices that can respond to their surroundings.\nSamuel Lam Hon-yuen, CEO of drone show operator X Social Group, said he believed such a committee could play a key role by channelling opinions among different stakeholders to create better conditions for product commercialisation.\nHe also called for greater diversity in industry committees.\n“In the past, some leading committees had been dominated by very academic people,” Lam said.\n“But the AI sector develops extremely fast and urgently needs input from practitioners across different industries – including industry, commerce, academia and research.”\n\nMichael So Chung-shing, founder of the Artificial Intelligence Application Research Society, or the AiX Society, emphasised that the industry was prone to fast changes and stressed the importance of speed for the committee.\nHe said the committee needed to do more than just “talk shop”, but added that finance chief Chan’s role as chairman could ensure the industry was more united, in addition to helping break down departmental barriers and efficiently mobilising resources.\n“The committee needs to include experts who are active on the front lines of the market and establish a rapid-response mechanism to translate the latest global technological trends, such as embodied AI, into policies that fit Hong Kong’s context,” So said.\n“We need to be able to quickly attract leading companies and provide them with application scenarios to seize the first-mover advantage.”\nLawmaker Wong highlighted significant regulatory obstacles in advancing life and health technology, as well as embodied AI.\n“The government could use the committee to coordinate regulatory sandboxes in the future,” he suggested, explaining that such initiatives would gather industry experiences across different application scenarios to help revise laws and address safety and legal concerns.\nWong said he believed the committee would also establish direct communication channels with mainland Chinese authorities, making it easier for Hong Kong companies to liaise directly with their counterparts across the border.\n",

            "title": "Fok welcomes ‘inspiring’ budget, says Asian Games will be part of funding review",
            "description": "Hong Kong lawmaker Kenneth Fok Kai‑kong welcomed the government’s HK$1.2 billion investment in sports development as “a timely boost that will inject fresh momentum”, while also urging a more strategic approach to building a sustainable sports industry.\nFok, who is also vice-president of the city’s Sports Federation and Olympic Committee (SF&amp;OC), said details on how the money could be spent would be decided following “a comprehensive review of athlete support planned after the Asian Games”.\nSpeaking on Thursday, he called the new funding inspiring, but said any plans for the future should involve looking at “how to invest in ownership and long‑term capacities that strengthen Hong Kong’s position in the global sports ecosystem”.\nSports development in the city still relied heavily on “subsidy-based models”, Fok said in a written response to the budget, adding that there should be a focus on creating a self-sustaining industry.\n“It is time to consolidate the positive economic effects of professionalisation and industrialisation to strengthen the sector’s self-sustaining capacity,” he wrote.\n\nFok’s was responding to Financial Secretary Paul Chan Mo‑po’s budget announcement on Wednesday, when he outlined the cash boost for resources to boost athlete training programmes, improve coaching standards and attract more international competitions to the city.\nChan said the government would also continue to partner with Kai Tak Sports Park to “attract more major international sports events and activities proactively”.\nThe minister added that the government remained committed to expanding the “M” Mark system, which provides financial support for events such as the Cathay/HSBC Hong Kong Sevens and next week’s HSBC LIV Golf Hong Kong to strengthen the city’s position as an international sports event capital.\nFok said the budget’s focus on the “mega-event economy” came at a fitting time, with KTSP marking its first anniversary.\n“I welcome the government’s active efforts to bring more international sporting events to Hong Kong, marking an important step towards enhancing sports collaboration within the Greater Bay Area,” Fok said.\nHe also voiced support for the government’s measure to strengthen training for team-sport athletes. Fok noted that the 2024–27 Team Sports Development Pilot Scheme provided HK$30 million a year to eight associations, including football, basketball and handball, and benefited about 430 athletes.\n“However, many team-sport athletes have continued training and representing Hong Kong despite the lack of stable support, and their perseverance and dedication truly deserve recognition,” Fok said.\n“I hope to take the opportunity of this year’s Asian Games to conduct a comprehensive review of the long-term development of team sports, including athlete welfare, coaching support and resource allocation to help more team disciplines reach the elite level.”\nThe broader sports community also welcomed the increased funding, saying the new policies would strengthen both elite performance and the city’s event-driven sports economy.\nIn a statement, the SF&amp;OC also welcomed the initiative, with president Timothy Fok Tsun-ting praising the government’s “steadfast support for sports development.”\nStrengthening team training and coaching standards would help raise performance levels, while leveraging the “M Mark” system would “elevate Hong Kong’s international sporting status”, he said.\n“SF&amp;OC will continue to work hand in hand with the sports sector to make good use of resources, support the implementation of these measures, and help the Hong Kong sports community seize this opportunity to reach new heights,” Timothy Fok added.\nPui Kwan-kay, chairman of the Football Association of Hong Kong, China, said the decision was “truly encouraging”, and believed it would directly benefit local football, particularly women’s and youth teams.\nMeanwhile, the Hong Kong Sports Institute, which receives hundreds of millions in taxpayer funds every year, said it hoped the extra money would lead to more diverse sports events being held in the city.\nTang King-shing, the institute’s chairman, also believed it would help the city’s athletes “reach new heights on the international stage”.\nThe Hong Kong Golf Club, which hosts the LIV tournament every year, said the event underscored the city’s growing appeal as a venue for international sports showcases.\n",

            "description": "Sun Hung Kai Properties (SHKP), Hong Kong’s largest developer by market capitalisation, reported a 36.2 per cent year-on-year jump in first-half net profit to HK$10.25 billion (US$1.3 billion).\nRevenue rose 32 per cent to HK$52.7 billion for the six months ended December from a year earlier, while operating income increased 10.7 per cent to HK$13.4 billion, the developer said in a filing to the Hong Kong stock exchange on Thursday. Underlying profit, which discounts property revaluations, gained 17 per cent to HK$12.2 billion.\nThe revenue, however, missed analysts’ estimates of HK$53.4 billion, while operating income beat forecasts of HK$12.82 billion, according to Bloomberg data.\nSHKP’s results are typically viewed as a bellwether of the city’s property market, given its extensive project pipeline and the scale of developments slated for completion in the coming years.\nChairman and managing director Raymond Kwok Ping-luen highlighted rising uncertainties brought about by geopolitical risks as well as the rapid development of artificial intelligence and robotics, noting that they were likely to lead the “global economy into uncharted waters”.\n\n“Despite increasing volatility in the market, anticipated further interest-rate cuts in the US, easing Sino-US tensions and accelerated investment in technology should support moderate global economic growth in 2026,” he said in the statement.\nKwok said the group planned to launch several new residential projects in Hong Kong over the next 10 months, including the second phase of Cullinan Harbour in Kai Tak, a project near the Tsuen Wan West MTR station, a project at Sha Po South in Yuen Long, the first phase of a large-scale development next to the Kwu Tung MTR station, a project near the City One MTR station in Sha Tin and the first phase of the Tung Shing Lei project in Yuen Long.\nSo far this year, the developer has sold out six rounds of sales totalling about 1,400 flats at its Sierra Sea project, the city’s largest residential development since 1999. Sierra Sea, located in Shap Sze Heung, between Sai Kung and Ma On Shan, consists of 9,700 units.\nSHKP’s major projects to be completed in Hong Kong from 2025 up to the end of its 2027-28 financial year would span 1.65 million sq ft to 4.37 million sq ft a year, it said in an earlier filing. Additionally, 10.3 million sq ft would be completed by the end of the 2028-29 financial year and beyond.\nInvestors have turned increasingly optimistic on Hong Kong’s property sector, singling out SHKP as a key beneficiary due to its 19.7 million sq ft of developable land, much of it tied to the government’s Northern Metropolis project, according to a note by Citi on Thursday.\nMeanwhile, annual earnings at Hysan Development, the largest commercial landlord in Causeway Bay, rose 28.3 per cent to HK$2.5 billion in 2025, driven mainly by the fair value gain from the disposal of flats in its upscale Bamboo Grove project in Mid-Levels, according to its filing on Thursday.\nIts recurring underlying profit, however, dropped 1.9 per cent to HK$1.91 billion, with chairman Irene Lee Yun-lien saying that “2025 was a pivotal year of progress and transformation for Hysan”.\nHysan’s turnover rose 1.6 per cent to HK$3.46 billion, with revenue from residential sales jumping 5 per cent, retail rising 2.6 per cent and office reporting flat growth.\nLast year, the company handed over 54 units in Bamboo Grove to buyers, with sales amounting to about HK$1.82 billion. With the units’ carrying value at HK$1.22 billion, Hysan said the disposal resulted in a fair value gain of HK$592 million.\nLooking ahead, Lee said 2026 would “present its own set of challenges”, but added that the group would be “battle-proven and ready”.\nHysan’s Lee Garden Eight project, a 1 million sq ft commercial development, will be ready in the third quarter of the year and will expand the company’s Lee Gardens leasable portfolio by about 30 per cent.\n",

On the mainland, the CSI 300 Index slid 0.2 per cent and the Shanghai Composite Index was little changed.\nAlibaba Group Holding declined 3.2 per cent to HK$143.60 and Tencent Holdings fell 2 per cent to HK$512. Meituan lost 2.7 per cent to HK$80.45 and JD.com retreated 2.6 per cent to HK$104.\nBucking the downtrend, Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing rose 0.8 per cent to HK$415.40 after posting a 38 per cent profit increase last year. CK Infrastructure Holdings added 4.5 per cent to HK$67, Power Assets Holdings rallied 3.8 per cent to HK$63.60 and CK Asset Holdings gained 3 per cent to HK$48.06 after agreeing to sell all of its interest in a UK power distributor for £10.5 billion (US$14.2 billion).\nRevenue for Nvidia, at the centre of the global AI frenzy, beat the consensus estimate but fell short of the most bullish projections of more than US$80 billion, sending its shares lower in after-hours trading. The US chipmaker reported a 73 per cent jump in quarterly revenue to US$68.1 billion for the three months ended January. That compared with the consensus estimate of US$65.8 billion.\n“The market is no longer pricing growth. It is pricing perpetuity,” said Stephen Innes, managing partner at SPI Asset Management. “When a company becomes the physical backbone of an industrial revolution, expectations detach from gravity. Investors are not asking whether revenue is growing. They are asking whether this growth can compound at escape velocity indefinitely.”\nThe muted reaction to Nvidia’s resilient earnings underscored a cooling of the AI mania globally and a rapid shift in the narrative that had driven up valuations of tech stocks. As the AI scare trade unfolds, investors have fretted over the impact on established industries and questioned the durability of massive investments in data centres.\nOther major Asian markets all closed higher. Japan’s Nikkei 225 climbed 0.3 per cent, while South Korea’s Kospi surged 3.7 per cent and Australia’s S&amp;P/ASX 200 added 0.5 per cent.\n",

            "title": "Nvidia reports record earnings quarter as China’s H200 sales freeze persists",
            "description": "Nvidia has yet to generate any revenue from its H200 chips in China and does not know if any sales will be allowed in the country, the company said, as the US chip giant reported record quarterly revenue on surging demand for data centre processors.\nWhile the Santa Clara-based tech giant remains the primary beneficiary of the global generative artificial intelligence boom, its ability to navigate the US-China tech war has become a challenge, with the pipeline for the H200 – Nvidia’s second-most powerful graphics processing unit to date – still dry in China.\nNo revenue had been booked from H200 chips and imports by China remained uncertain, despite small amounts being cleared by Washington for China-based customers, said Colette Kress, Nvidia’s executive vice-president and chief financial officer, during a post-earnings call on Thursday.\nThe remarks echoed those of US Commerce Department official David Peters, who said on Tuesday that Nvidia had yet to sell any H200 units in China.\nThe comments underscore regulatory uncertainty from Beijing regarding the imports of the GPU, which remains a key option for Chinese tech giants to train their AI models, after it was cleared by Washington in January on condition that the shipments do not exceed 50 per cent of the volume sold in the US.\nKress also flagged rising competition in China, where domestic chipmakers have rushed to initial public offerings (IPOs) in recent months to meet soaring demand and position themselves as alternatives to Nvidia.\n\n“Our competitors in China, bolstered by recent IPOs, are making progress and have the potential to disrupt the structure of the global AI industry over the long term,” said Kress, who added that the US must “engage every developer and be the platform of choice for every commercial business, including those in China” to maintain its leadership in AI computing.\nNvidia’s revenue in China fell to US$19.7 billion for the financial year ended January 25, down from US$25 billion a year earlier, according to its latest earnings release.\nJensen Huang, president and CEO of Nvidia, struck an upbeat tone, highlighting the company’s deeper partnerships this quarter with leading frontier model makers including OpenAI, Meta, Anthropic and xAI, which will use Nvidia’s Blackwell and coming Rubin processors for training and inference.\nThe optimism was reflected in the company’s quarterly earnings. It reported a revenue of US$68.1 billion for the quarter ended on January 25, up 73 per cent from a year earlier, beating the consensus estimate of US$65.8 billion. That was largely attributed to growth in its data centre revenue, which surged 75 per cent year on year to a record US$62.3 billion.\nFor the current financial quarter, it expected revenue to be around US$78 billion, compared with US$26 billion from the same period last year, also above forecasts.\nHuang said the company was able to move quickly because global demand for tokens had “gone completely exponential” as the industry went through an inflection point.\n“We know that the amount of computation necessary for the modern way of doing software is growing exponentially, and our strategy is to deliver an entire AI infrastructure every single year,” he said.\nThe earnings came amid concerns about AI’s economic impact, after a report by US research outfit Citrini forecast mass unemployment and recession by 2028 due to agentic AI models. The warning triggered a sell-off on Wall Street, as investors feared traditional business models could be cannibalised.\n“At a system level, we expect Nvidia to continue to be the leader across both training and reasoning-focused inference workloads,” Citi Research analysts said in a recent note. As rising capital expenditure levels among US hyperscalers raised concerns over an AI bubble, these investments would reaccelerate industry revenue and earnings growth, they added.\nNvidia shares initially jumped nearly 4 per cent in after-hours trading on the earnings beat before paring gains to trade flat.\n",

            "description": "A Hong Kong court has sentenced the father of a wanted activist to eight months in jail for attempting to cash out an insurance policy worth more than HK$88,000 (US$11,251) in his daughter’s name, rejecting suggestions that the sentence amounted to “collective punishment” against a relative of a fugitive.\nKwok Yin-sang, 69, became the first person jailed for trying to deal with the financial assets of an absconder – his 29-year-old daughter, Anna Kwok Fung-yee, a United States-based activist who had a HK$1 million bounty placed on her head in 2023, for allegedly violating the Beijing-decreed national security law.\nAnna Kwok, the executive director of the US-based Hong Kong Democracy Council, is wanted by national security police for allegedly colluding with foreign forces by instigating sanctions against Hong Kong and mainland China.\nThe elder Kwok, who runs a local engineering firm, was convicted of violating the city’s domestic national security law between January and February last year after twice attempting to cash out a life and personal accident insurance policy with AIA International. He had bought the policy for his daughter when she was 22 months old.\nThe defence argued that Kwok had paid all the premiums and believed the policy formed part of his own assets, giving him control over the funds.\nDefence counsel Steven Kwan Man-wai told Andy Cheng Lim-chi, acting principal magistrate of West Kowloon Court, that the father should not be punished for his daughter’s fugitive status, saying otherwise it would amount to “collective punishment”.\nKwan contended that the ordinance was intended to target crimes endangering national security, not to exert pressure on individuals.\nCheng explained that in his reasons for sentence, the legislative intent of the relevant provision was to prevent anyone from dealing with an absconder’s assets, thereby “reaching the intended effect of punishing the absconders”.\n“This case targeted the absconders’ assets and whether the defendant’s act would enable the fugitive to remain at large,” he said. “Collective punishment does not exist. Whether the defendant is the relative of the absconder is also irrelevant.”\nAlthough the magistrate accepted that Kwok’s actions did not directly endanger national security, he ruled that the attempt to access his daughter’s assets could have made her less likely to return to Hong Kong because someone else could have handled it for her.\n\nCheng had earlier found that the activist was the policy’s sole beneficiary, while her father merely held the proceeds in trust and had no authority to transfer or withdraw funds without her consent.\nKwok met his daughter in Japan in early 2025 to obtain her signature on an application form, which he later discovered was out of date and no longer valid.\nInsurance agent Cheng Wai-yee, who had handled policies taken out by Kwok for his three children, suggested that he sign next to his daughter’s name after he said she would be unable to sign a new form soon.\nAIA’s records indicated that Kwok remained the policy owner even after his daughter reached adulthood. The agent could not explain why the record had not been updated.\nProsecutors alleged that Kwok had twice attempted to deal with the insurance policy, while the defence argued he was merely processing a change of ownership application.\nDuring mitigation, the defence sought a short custodial sentence or a community service order. Magistrate Cheng rejected the request, noting that Kwok had shown no remorse, having been convicted after trial.\nCiting classical sentencing principles, Cheng said any offence endangering national security must serve the purposes of deterrence, retribution, denunciation and incapacitation.\nConsidering the seriousness of the case, the magistrate set a starting point of nine months’ imprisonment before reducing it by one month to reflect Kwok’s clear record and age.\n",

            "title": "Long-term gains worthwhile, Paul Chan says amid budget sweetener complaints",
            "description": "Hong Kong’s financial chief has defended his latest budget against public criticism over the lack of sweeteners, stressing that the government must balance its finances with long-term investments for the city’s benefit.\nFinancial Secretary Paul Chan Mo-po said on Thursday he would brief credit-rating agencies and the International Monetary Fund next month on his budget, including the proposed HK$150 billion (US$19.2 billion) transfer from the Exchange Fund to support infrastructure projects.\nHis remarks at a radio forum followed Wednesday’s budget announcement to transfer investment income from the fund, which has raised concerns about the city’s financial stability.\nDuring the forum, callers complained that the budget offered too little support for the general public.\n“I am disappointed that giving out money or consumption vouchers has fallen off the radar. You hold a consultation every year, but you never listen … the budget consultation is meaningless,” a resident surnamed Tang said.\nChan explained that the government had used different approaches to put more money back into people’s pockets, including increasing tax allowances, offering tax reductions and organising more events to lure tourists.\n“It can boost businesses, creating more job opportunities and higher incomes for residents. We remain committed to that, as it also brings long-term benefits,” he said.\nHe added that the tax relief measures could help a family with two children save about HK$10,000 a year.\nThe middle class also raised concerns. Another resident surnamed Chan, who has a child and a combined monthly income of around HK$70,000 with his wife, said he hoped the government would offer more support to families not eligible for many welfare benefits.\n“We cannot buy subsidised housing as we have passed the asset limit, so we buy a private flat. After deducting all the expenses, we can only save about HK$10,000 to HK$20,000 per month,” he said.\nSecretary Chan responded that the government had proposed a significant increase in the basic and child tax allowances and would support residents as much as possible within its capacity.\n“At the end of the day, we’re still in the stage of economic recovery. We’ll need to issue bonds in the future, so we have to strike a balance,” he said.\nChan added that the government’s relief measures reached HK$22 billion and that it needed to remain financially cautious.\n\nAnother resident, surnamed Tsang, asked why the government chose to invest in the Northern Metropolis megaproject that would benefit the other side of the border instead of supporting the general public.\nChan stressed that it was “worthwhile” to invest in the project, which aims to transform 30,000 hectares of land near the city’s border with the mainland into an economic powerhouse and housing hub.\n“Previously, when we invested in research and development and universities for technology and innovation development, all the commercialised production went to mainland China. Shenzhen and the Greater Bay Area pocketed all the economic benefits,” Chan said.\n“Now, the Northern Metropolis is the future innovation and technology hub. We will attract enterprises to Hong Kong. The tax return is ours, employment is ours, commercialisation is ours.”\nAsked whether bond issuance was no longer sufficient to cover infrastructure expenses, prompting the government to seek a transfer from the Exchange Fund, Chan said he was considering both options to support the metropolis’ development.\n“We have many money pockets … Last year, the Exchange Fund investment return was very good, with over HK$330 billion. Whether the money is in the Exchange Fund or used for infrastructure in the Northern Metropolis, both are investments,” he said.\n",

            "title": "‘Worst is yet to come’: Hong Kong’s early childhood sector hit hard by funding cuts",
            "description": "The early childhood education sector will receive its lowest level of subsidy in more than a decade as the number of preschools falls to a 13-year low, with the government cancelling two grants for kindergartens in the new school year.\nAccording to the annual budget announced on Wednesday, the early childhood sector will receive only HK$4.5 billion (US$575 million) from the government in 2026–27, representing a 6.6 per cent drop from the current financial year.\n“This is mainly due to decreased provision for some existing grants to kindergartens in 2026–27, largely as a result of the decrease in the number of students,” the budget said.\nThe government estimated there would be just 105,800 toddlers enrolled in kindergartens in the next school year, of whom 79,000 would attend subsidised institutions – both record lows.\nThe sector suffered the largest cut in resources among all areas overseen by the Education Bureau. By comparison, the primary and secondary education sectors will see reductions of less than 2 per cent and 1 per cent respectively, from the previous financial year.\nThe tertiary and vocational education sectors, meanwhile, will enjoy an increase of 4 per cent.\nOverall, subsidies for early childhood education have fallen by 30 per cent compared with their peak in 2020–21, as the number of students in subsidised kindergartens has dropped by nearly 40 per cent over the same period.\nThe total number of kindergartens has fallen to 958 in the current school year, meaning 22 institutions closed last year – a new low since 2013, according to the budget.\nThe number is expected to decline further by the end of this school year. As of the end of last month, statistics from the bureau showed that 18 preschools were set to close by then.\nA preschool representative warned that the sector had become a ‘sunset industry’, with teachers losing their jobs as schools shut down. She added that the government had introduced no new measures to boost Hong Kong’s record-low birth rate.\nOn Wednesday, the Education Bureau said it would scrap two subsidies – one for kindergarten activities and another for hiring substitute teachers – which cost the government HK$15.9 million and HK$24.9 million respectively in the last school year.\nAccording to calculations by the South China Morning Post, each subsidised kindergarten will lose about HK$40,000 in funding on average.\nHowever, the Education Bureau will not cut the unit subsidy or per-student subsidy in the coming school year, although it had earlier indicated a planned 2 per cent reduction.\n\nPreschools will be allowed to use their unit subsidies or other existing resources to cover expenses previously funded by the two now cancelled grants, including off-campus activities and substitute teacher hiring.\nChoi Lai-fong, vice-chairwoman of the Hong Kong Federation of Education Workers and a preschool principal, said the scrapping of the two grants would further strain kindergartens’ budgets, which were already under pressure from the low birth rate.\nShe said the grim outlook brought by continuous cuts in government support and shrinking student numbers would not only lead to more school closures but also more dismissals of teaching staff.\n“We are truly miserable because we are now actually a sunset industry. Kindergarten management has no choice but to keep sacking teachers if the budget is further tightened,” she said, adding that the sector bore the brunt of the structural decline in births while other fields might only feel the impact years later.\n“We have trained lots of preschool teachers over the years, but now they are facing such unstable job conditions. Are we telling students studying early childhood to switch to other fields upon graduation?”\nShe warned that the worst was yet to come, as Hong Kong’s birth numbers have remained low in recent years and many of the few babies born have not yet reached preschool age.\nThe budget proposed increasing the existing child allowance from HK$130,000 to HK$140,000. Choi said it remained unclear whether the rise would have any tangible effect on boosting the birth rate.\nIn a previous budget, the government announced a one-off cash reward of HK$20,000 for each eligible baby born from October 25, 2023, over a three-year period, with a total budget of HK$2.28 billion.\nBut the latest data showed that only around 56 per cent of the budget had been used so far, while the programme will end in October.\nOnly 31,100 babies were born in 2025 – the lowest number on record.\nChoi expressed hope that the government would exclude expenses for senior teaching staff engaged only in administrative work when calculating teaching headcounts, enabling preschools to allocate more resources to classroom teachers.\n",

            "description": "Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing (HKEX), which operates Asia’s third-largest stock exchange, reported a record-high annual profit for the second straight year, thanks to higher market turnover and robust listing activity, it said in a stock exchange filing on Thursday.\nNet profit in 2025 increased 36 per cent to HK$17.75 billion (US$2.28 billion), or HK$14.05 per share, from HK$13 billion a year earlier, which was also a record. The result beat market expectations of HK$17.44 billion.\nThe bourse operator proposed a second interim dividend of HK$6.52 per share, bringing the total to HK$12.52 for the year, versus HK$9.26 in 2024, and maintaining the payout at 90 per cent of earnings.\nNet profit in the final three months of 2025 also jumped 15 per cent to HK$4.34 billion, from HK$3.78 billion a year earlier. This also beat the market estimate at HK$3.8 billion.\n“In 2025, HKEX reinforced its role as a global superconnector, regained its position as the world’s leading venue for IPOs and set new trading as well as financial performance records,” HKEX CEO Bonnie Chan Yiting said in the result announcement.\n“While we expect volatility to persist amid the prevailing macro landscape in 2026, we also see cause for optimism in capital markets as global investors adjust to the ongoing uncertainty of an increasingly multipolar world by seeking diversification and risk management opportunities in Asian and specifically Chinese assets.”\nShe will meet the media this afternoon to discuss the result and the company’s future plans.\nHKEX shares fell 0.8 per cent on Thursday morning before the results announcement.\nThe bourse is expected to introduce more reforms in the coming year. Financial Secretary Paul Chan Mo-po, in his budget speech on Wednesday, said the exchange would consult the market on how to shorten transaction settlement times from the current two days after transaction to one day, known as T+1.\nHe also said the exchange would propose in the first quarter how to reform the weighted voting rights of companies and explore measures to attract international companies for secondary listings in Hong Kong.\nThe exchange’s strong profits were driven by rising daily stock turnover, which increased 90 per cent to HK$249.8 billion in 2025, lifting HKEX’s trading fee income by 80 per cent to HK$6.17 billion and clearing fees by 58 per cent to HK$5.71 billion, according to its filing.\n\nThe surge in market turnover came amid a broader market rally, with the benchmark Hang Seng Index jumping 28 per cent last year as international investors rushed to buy mainland tech stocks.\nMeanwhile, HKEX also introduced several reforms to attract listings by mainland firms, leading to a 9 per cent increase in listing fees to HK$964 million in 2025.\nThe main board reclaimed the global top spot for IPO fundraising in 2025 after a prolonged slump, with 114 companies raising US$37.22 billion, according to LSEG Data &amp; Analytics.\nThe resurgence came after two lacklustre years. Hong Kong’s IPO value fell to a 20-year low of US$5.9 billion from 68 listings in 2023, ranking eighth worldwide. In 2024, 64 IPOs raised US$11 billion, placing the city fifth globally.\nHKEX booked a net investment gain of HK$1.87 billion from its portfolio of global stocks and bonds last year, up 7 per cent from a HK$1.75 billion gain in 2024.\nAll futures and options contracts traded averaged 1.7 million per day in 2025, 7 per cent higher than a year earlier, setting a record for the fourth consecutive year. Average daily turnover of derivative warrants and other derivative products rose 55 per cent to HK$18.3 billion last year.\nThe stock exchange also handled 39 billion yuan (US$5.7 billion) of yuan-denominated bond transactions per day by offshore investors through the Bond Connect scheme, a 6 per cent decrease from a year earlier.\n",

Initially slated for release as early as June, he is now serving a 20-year national security sentence.\nWong Wai-keung, 61, a chief administrative officer at Next Digital, was jailed for 21 months.\nNeither Lai nor Wong was in court on Thursday.\nIn quashing the conviction, the three judges found that the common law rule on which the prosecution relied only attributed criminal liability to a company through the acts of its directors or other high-level managers.\n“It does not operate in an opposite way of attributing the company’s criminal liability to its officers,” the justices found.\nThe court said that based on the available evidence, the prosecution failed to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that Lai and Wong had made the false representation.\n“The court therefore concluded that the prosecution had failed to prove the applicants had committed the actus reus of the fraud charges,” it said.\nIt also said the trial judge had failed to consider “certain important matters” relevant to Lai’s state of mind.\n\nDuring the initial trial, the court heard that terms for Apple Daily’s land lease included a ban on using office space for purposes other than “publishing and printing of newspapers and magazines and ancillary services”.\nDico Consultants, which provided secretarial services to private companies controlled by Lai’s family and managed the tycoon’s personal assets, allegedly fell outside permitted purposes in the lease.\nThe landlord, Hong Kong Science and Technology Parks Corporation, never received any licensing application since Dico’s 646 sq ft office opened in April 1998.\nThe paper was said to have earned at least HK$1.09 million in rent from the consultancy, which was able to evade up to HK$110 million in land premiums.\nIn his background report, Lai told a probation officer he should not have been held liable for Next Digital’s contractual breaches as he had not been involved in its daily operations.\nInstead, Lai blamed his then chief operating officer, Royston Chow Tat-kuen, who was granted immunity from prosecution after he agreed to help in the cases against his former boss and colleague.\nEarlier this month, Lai was sentenced to 20 years in jail on two conspiracy counts of collusion with foreign forces under the Beijing-decreed national security law, and a third count of conspiracy to print and distribute seditious articles in breach of local legislation.\nThe toughest punishment so far under the law pushed his earliest possible release date to 2044, assuming he is not granted a one-third reduction for good behaviour under the city’s domestic national security law.\n",

            "title": "Nvidia reports record earnings quarter as China’s H200 sales freeze persists",
            "description": "Nvidia has yet to generate any revenue from its H200 chips in China and does not know if any sales will be allowed in the country, the company said, as the US chip giant reported record quarterly revenue on surging demand for data centre processors.\nWhile the Santa Clara-based tech giant remains the primary beneficiary of the global generative artificial intelligence boom, its ability to navigate the US-China tech war has become a challenge, with the pipeline for the H200 – Nvidia’s second-most powerful graphics processing unit to date – still dry in China.\nNo revenue had been booked from H200 chips and imports by China remained uncertain, despite small amounts being cleared by Washington for China-based customers, said Colette Kress, Nvidia’s executive vice-president and chief financial officer, during a post-earnings call on Thursday.\nThe remarks echoed those of US Commerce Department official David Peters, who said on Tuesday that Nvidia had yet to sell any H200 units in China.\nThe comments underscore regulatory uncertainty from Beijing regarding the imports of the GPU, which remains a key option for Chinese tech giants to train their AI models, after it was cleared by Washington in January on condition that the shipments do not exceed 50 per cent of the volume sold in the US.\nKress also flagged rising competition in China, where domestic chipmakers have rushed to initial public offerings (IPOs) in recent months to meet soaring demand and position themselves as alternatives to Nvidia.\n\n“Our competitors in China, bolstered by recent IPOs, are making progress and have the potential to disrupt the structure of the global AI industry over the long term,” said Kress, who added that the US must “engage every developer and be the platform of choice for every commercial business, including those in China” to maintain its leadership in AI computing.\nNvidia’s revenue in China fell to US$19.7 billion for the financial year ended January 25, down from US$25 billion a year earlier, according to its latest earnings release.\nJensen Huang, president and CEO of Nvidia, struck an upbeat tone, highlighting the company’s deeper partnerships this quarter with leading frontier model makers including OpenAI, Meta, Anthropic and xAI, which will use Nvidia’s Blackwell and coming Rubin processors for training and inference.\nThe optimism was reflected in the company’s quarterly earnings. It reported a revenue of US$68.1 billion for the quarter ended on January 25, up 73 per cent from a year earlier, beating the consensus estimate of US$65.8 billion. That was largely attributed to growth in its data centre revenue, which surged 75 per cent year on year to a record US$62.3 billion.\nFor the current financial quarter, it expected revenue to be around US$78 billion, compared with US$26 billion from the same period last year, also above forecasts.\nHuang said the company was able to move quickly because global demand for tokens had “gone completely exponential” as the industry went through an inflection point.\n“We know that the amount of computation necessary for the modern way of doing software is growing exponentially, and our strategy is to deliver an entire AI infrastructure every single year,” he said.\nThe earnings came amid concerns about AI’s economic impact, after a report by US research outfit Citrini forecast mass unemployment and recession by 2028 due to agentic AI models. The warning triggered a sell-off on Wall Street, as investors feared traditional business models could be cannibalised.\n“At a system level, we expect Nvidia to continue to be the leader across both training and reasoning-focused inference workloads,” Citi Research analysts said in a recent note. As rising capital expenditure levels among US hyperscalers raised concerns over an AI bubble, these investments would reaccelerate industry revenue and earnings growth, they added.\nNvidia shares initially jumped nearly 4 per cent in after-hours trading on the earnings beat before paring gains to trade flat.\n",

            "title": "Huawei joins OpenAI, Google in push to advance AI standards in rare collab",
            "description": "Chinese tech giant Huawei Technologies has joined hands with US companies OpenAI and Google to advance global open-source standards in the rapidly advancing field of agentic artificial intelligence.\nThe development marks a rare collaboration between a US-sanctioned Chinese heavyweight and its US counterparts in global AI standards setting amid US-China geopolitical and tech competition.\nOn Tuesday, the Agentic AI Foundation (AAIF) announced Huawei as one of 97 new members joining its ranks, bringing its total membership to 146 organisations.\nHuawei and Beijing-headquartered PC maker Lenovo were the first Chinese companies to join as members, with most other members hailing from Europe and North America.\nLaunched in December by the Linux Foundation, a non-profit that promotes open source technology, the AAIF’s mission is to “[unite] cutting-edge technology and open source governance to shape the future of open and accessible AI”.\nIts founding members include OpenAI, Anthropic, Google and Microsoft.\nThe body said that the rapid expansion of its membership reflected “strong industry demand for shared, open standards”.\nAgentic AI, which refers to AI systems that can perform tasks with a high degree of autonomy and reliability, is widely seen as the next frontier of AI, with tech giants globally racing to introduce cutting-edge products.\nIn just the past two months, advances in agentic AI such as OpenAI’s OpenClaw and Anthropic’s Claude Code have made international headlines and precipitated market sell-off in the US.\n\n\nHuawei and Lenovo were two of 18 new “gold members” to join the body, the second tier of membership, alongside JPMorgan Chase and Japanese conglomerate Hitachi.\nAs one of China’s biggest tech companies, Huawei is increasingly seen as a key pillar of the country’s AI industry due to its domestically leading semiconductor chip and digital infrastructure offerings.\nHuawei has pioneered some of China’s leading open-source AI software such as MindSpore – a deep learning framework – as well as CANN (Compute Architecture for Neural Networks), the software customised to operate with its Ascend semiconductor chips, similar to Nvidia’s CUDA (Compute Unified Device Architecture).\nHowever, its prominence has also made it a regular target of US sanctions, including export control rules restricting global use of Ascend chips.\nNonetheless, Huawei has emerged in recent years as a global leader in standards-setting for emerging technologies such as 4G and 5G. Some experts have blamed US sanctions for deterring US companies from participating in standards-setting bodies involving Huawei, thus ceding ground to the Chinese company at key institutions such as the United Nations.\n“[Huawei] serves as a paradigm of technology catch-up through standardisation, transitioning from a latecomer enterprise to a leading multinational company,” scholars Wei Yang and Yurong Zhang wrote in a Nature article published last year.\nIn a statement, Huawei’s chief open source liaison officer Bill Ren Xudong said that agentic AI was a core pillar of the Shenzhen-based tech giant’s business, adding that it was “excited” to collaborate with other member firms.\n“We firmly believe that working together in open source will bring forth many new exciting innovations for the shared benefit of all,” he said.\nThe AAIF will host a summit for new and existing members in New York City in early April.\n",

            "title": "Hong Kong 2026-27 budget: ‘Symphony of Lights’ to go dark under tourism revamp",
            "description": "Hong Kong will cancel the two-decade-old “A Symphony of Lights” within the year, with the South China Morning Post learning that the fixture will be replaced with immersive projections across various districts to upgrade the city’s offerings.\nThe revamp is among a raft of new tourism measures announced in finance chief Paul Chan Mo-po’s latest budget, with others including a push for Hong Kong to become a destination for study tours and a HK$200 million (US$25.6 million) fund to revitalise rural villages.\nThe blueprint also earmarked HK$1.2 billion for the sports sector to “further promote sports development”.\nChan revealed on Wednesday that the Hong Kong Tourism Board (HKTB) would receive HK$1.66 billion in funding – a 35 per cent increase from the previous year.\n“Building on the success of last year’s ‘Immersive Light Show in Central’ featuring spectacular 3D light shows, the HKTB will launch a brand new show with the theme of light festivals across various locations at different times of the year to replace A Symphony of Lights,” Chan said.\nHe was referring to light projections concentrated around the Statue Square Gardens over the Christmas and New Year periods.\nA source told the SCMP that similar installations would be set up in several districts across the city, including those popular with tourists, such as Central and Tsim Sha Tsui, although authorities had yet to finalise the list of places.\nThe insider added that the nightly A Symphony of Lights show would be gradually phased out “later this year”.\n“The harbour is already very bright and beautiful nowadays, so it was decided we should go in a different direction,” the source said.\n\n\nThe overhaul will use residual funds from the 2024-25 budget, under which Chan gave HK$1.09 billion to the tourism industry, including HK$354 million for the HKTB to revamp the decades-old light show.\nTimothy Chui Ting-pong, executive director of the Hong Kong Tourism Association, said he supported the move as a projection show would be able to do more.\nHe said that the measure would also be able draw tourists to other lesser-known locations.\nThe HK$1.66 billion allocated to the HKTB this year would go towards upgrading and promoting flagship events and festivities, among other areas.\nThe source said authorities were keen to concentrate more on holidays and festivals that are “not as prominent, or cannot be experienced, on the mainland,” including Halloween and the Mid-Autumn Festival’s Tai Hang Fire Dragon Dance.\n“The HKTB will draw more overnight visitors by stepping up marketing efforts in source markets with potential, including mainland cities outside Guangdong, as well as emerging markets such as Asean and the Middle East,” Chan said.\nThe minister added that efforts would be made to promote the city’s “meetings, incentives, conferences, and exhibitions”, or MICE, economy.\nThe source said that government efforts to promote tourism to Middle Eastern travellers had been satisfactory so far, noting visitors from the region had increased by 37 per cent year on year to about 92,000 in 2025.\nThe city welcomed 9,700 visitors from the region in January 2026 alone, up by 78 per cent from the same month last year.\nThe source added that such visitors were considered “high value” as they tended to be “young, fast-growing and wealthy”, spending an average of HK$11,300 per trip per capita - nearly twice as much as the HK$5,500 spent by the average overnight visitor.\nChan also proposed allocating HK$200 million to launch a pilot “NM Urban-rural Integration Fund” to encourage more northern rural villages to “take forward rural tourism projects and bring economic vitality”.\n\nA source said “non-governmental organisations and relevant bodies” would be required to submit proposals on hardware upgrades, such as simple structural enhancements for facilities and installations, or “software” plans, such as coming up with tour itineraries for visitors.\nDetails would be further announced as the government pitched the scheme to the Legislative Council in mid-2026, the source added.\nWalk in Hong Kong co-founder Paul Chan Chi-yuen said authorities would have to consider several areas, including how to make better use of the existing vacant spaces in rural villages and ensuring there were enough support measures to facilitate tourism.\nHe noted that rural villages typically had vacant land and homes, adding that some makeshift installations could be used to elevate the tourism value of those sites.\nOn the education front, authorities expressed hope on Wednesday morning that tertiary education institutions would launch more short-term study tours, especially during summer breaks when campus resources were idle, to encourage non-local participants to study in the city.\n“Through quality study tour experiences, students can deepen their understanding of Hong Kong, helping local tertiary institutions expand their student recruitment channels and attract talent to Hong Kong,” the Education Bureau said, adding that such tours could generate additional income for the institutions.\nA government source said such tours could focus on themes such as technology and innovation, arts and culture, or commerce and creativity, describing them as areas where Hong Kong had advantages.\nParticipants could visit laboratories, attend master-class talks and workshops, and immerse themselves in cultural experiences, the insider said.\nFinance chief Chan also said the sports portion of the Arts and Sport Development Fund would receive HK$1.2 billion to “further promote sports development, including strengthening training for team sports athletes, improving the professional standards of coaches, as well as supporting and exploring more diverse and higher-level sports competitions to be held in Hong Kong”.\nLawmaker Kenneth Fok Kai-kong, whose constituency covers the sports sector, welcomed the funding and said it would inject fresh momentum into the sector.\n“Hong Kong’s sports development has long leaned heavily on subsidies,” he said. “In the long run, we must consolidate the economic benefits of professionalisation and industrialisation to enhance the industry’s sustainability.”\nFok also called for more support for team-based sports training, while urging a broader review of athlete treatment, coaching support and resource allocation to help promising projects reach elite status.\n",

            "description": "A consortium comprising CK Infrastructure Holdings, CK Asset Holdings and Power Assets Holdings has agreed to sell all of its interest in UK Power Networks to French multinational electric utility Engie in a deal worth £10.5 billion (US$14.2 billion).\nThe disposal, under an agreement signed on Wednesday, will enable the group to monetise its investment at an attractive valuation, delivering a significant accounting gain and cash proceeds for future investments or acquisitions, the group of companies said in a joint filing to Hong Kong’s stock exchange on Thursday morning.\nUK Power Networks is 40 per cent owned by CK Infrastructure, 40 per cent by Power Assets and 20 per cent by CK Asset. It is one of the United Kingdom’s largest power distributors, comprising three regional networks with a distribution area that covers 8.3 million consumers in London, southeastern and eastern England, with power lines spanning around 190,000km. The CK group acquired the UK electricity operator in 2010, for £5.77 billion.\nGroup chairman Victor Li Tzar-kuoi said it would continue to “identify and pursue investment opportunities whether in regulated industries or businesses with long-term secure contracts, or other businesses which offer great potential, in existing and new markets, including the UK and beyond”.\nThe chief executive of Engie, Catherine MacGregor, said: “The acquisition of UK Power Networks marks a major milestone in the implementation of our strategic priorities.”\n",
