            "title": "China’s Okinawa remarks challenge militarisation, not sovereignty: analysts",
            "description": "Chinese observers downplayed Beijing’s reference to Okinawans as “indigenous”, saying the comments were primarily a critique of the militarisation of Japan’s southernmost prefecture – home to dozens of US military bases – rather than a challenge to Tokyo’s sovereignty over Okinawa.\\nOn October 9, China’s deputy permanent representative to the United Nations, Sun Lei, urged Japan to “stop prejudice and discrimination against Okinawans and other indigenous peoples”.\\nSun made the remarks during a general debate meeting of the Third Committee, the United Nations General Assembly’s principal human rights committee. During the meeting, Sun commented on human rights issues and raised concerns over several countries including Japan.\\nOkinawa lies on a fault line in Sino-Japanese ties and regional politics. The prefecture governs the Japanese-controlled Diaoyu Islands, known as the Senkaku Islands in Japan, which are at the centre of a long-standing territorial dispute between Beijing and Tokyo.\\nThe Ainu in northern Japan are the only group officially recognised as indigenous people by Tokyo.\\nAccording to a Chinese statement, Sun told the UN meeting: “China urged Japan to confront the history of its militaristic aggression against neighbouring Asian countries and colonial rule during World War II … [and to] genuinely improve the social status of women and end prejudice and discrimination against Okinawans and other indigenous peoples.”\\nSun’s remarks were picked up by media last month. A Japanese report, citing a Ryukoku University professor, said the statement suggested “a shift in Beijing’s recognition” of Okinawa that could affect US military bases and potentially support the prefecture’s autonomy.\\nSome have speculated that Beijing could try to challenge Japan’s control over Okinawa, which was once known as the kingdom of Ryukyu. The ancient kingdom was a Chinese tributary state in the East China Sea for more than 500 years until it was annexed by Japan in 1879.\\nOkinawa is strategically located just 110 km (68 miles) east of Taiwan and has a heavy American military presence, making it vital in the event of a conflict between China and the US.\\n\\n\\nZheng Zhihua, an associate professor at Shanghai Jiao Tong University, said Sun’s recent remarks should not be overinterpreted.\\nThe comments were brief and “quite restrained” and should be understood in the broader context of opposing excessive militarisation and advocating respect for local communities’ rights, according to Zheng.\\n“As competition between China and the US has intensified, Okinawa’s military significance has once again become prominent. In particular, US actions over Taiwan issues over the past two years have heightened Okinawa’s strategic importance,” he said.\\n“China’s intention is to express that Okinawa should not again become a military fortress but return to being a hub of peace and trade in East Asia, as it once was historically,” said Zheng, who heads the East Asia Marine Policy Project at the university’s Centre for Japanese Studies.\\nTrade and exchanges between Ryukyu and China flourished from the 14th century onwards, and the kingdom became a tributary state to the Ming dynasty (1368-1644). But Japanese influence grew in subsequent centuries before Ryukyu was annexed by Japan in 1879 and became Okinawa prefecture.\\nIn 2023, Chinese President Xi Jinping raised eyebrows when he referred to Okinawa prefecture as Ryukyu, discussing the kingdom’s links to southeastern China’s Fujian province.\\nAlthough Okinawa’s governor Denny Tamaki welcomed the comments as evidence of Xi’s willingness to develop ties with the Ryukyu Islands, some Japanese media outlets expressed concern, saying it showed that China might play up the issue of Okinawa’s sovereignty in the future.\\nWang Guangtao, deputy director of the Centre for Japanese Studies at Fudan University in Shanghai, noted that pro-autonomy groups in Okinawa had long sought recognition from the UN, and Sun’s reference to Okinawans as indigenous reflected awareness of these advocacy efforts.\\nBut Beijing’s official stance would remain cautious and consistent, Wang said.\\n“Okinawa is still under Japan’s claim as a prefecture within its sovereign territory. From the perspective of the Chinese government, if Japan doesn’t cross any red lines on Taiwan issues, China’s stance on the issue would not be too extreme.”\\nWhen Beijing and Tokyo established diplomatic ties in 1972, they agreed to mutually respect sovereignty and territorial integrity, and Beijing has never officially questioned Japan’s rule over Okinawa.\\nAfter Japan surrendered in September 1945, ending World War II, the Ryukyu Islands were placed under US control. That continued until 1972, when the US – concerned about the spread of communism in Asia – transferred its control of the islands to Japan on condition that the US retain its military bases there.\\nOkinawa is home to 1.4 million people. It also hosts 32 US military bases, including Kadena Air Base – the largest US military installation in the Asia-Pacific region and home to the largest wing in the US Air Force. Some 30,000 US service members are based in Okinawa, along with 50,000 civilian employees and family members, according to US military sources.\\n",

            "description": "The man overseeing the development of fencing in Hong Kong has said he is targeting gold medals for some of his charges at this month’s National Games – but refused to reveal the number he has in mind.\\nZheng Kangzhao, the city’s head coach, said the current crop of fencers in all three weapon categories – foil, épée and sabre – were better placed to triumph than their predecessors.\\nSpearheading the challenge will be two-time Olympic champion Cheung Ka-long and his fellow foilist Ryan Choi Chun-yin, the reigning world champion.\\nAnd they will take to the piste in familiar surroundings, with Hong Kong’s Kai Tak Arena staging the fencing events from November 15 to 20 as the city co-hosts the Games alongside Guangdong and Macau.\\n\\n“It’s on my wish list [to win golds], and we are playing at home,” said Zheng, who has been in charge for 14½ years. “It’s a grand slam [opportunity] for us … we have won everything we could internationally. The China Games was the only missing piece, so that’s my wish.”\\nHe said focusing on process would yield the desired results.\\n“I haven’t discussed with [Cheung or Choi] about winning medals,” Zheng said. “I just want them to enjoy the Games. Do you think they don’t want to win?\\n“We cannot be too greedy. Sometimes, having too many demands and desires can become a source of pressure. I have a number in mind, but I am not saying it.\\n“I didn’t even tell any of my coaches; I didn’t tell them what they should do. More often, I said, ‘If you train well, plan well, manage the athletes well and handle the process well, the results will follow naturally.’\\n“Our men’s foil, both individual and the team, have chances. For the other weapons, we have chances, but it’s not [a given]. It depends on our performance on the day.”\\nThe foilists, except Cheung, and the sabreists will first take part in World Cup legs in Spain and Algeria next week before returning home to prepare for the quadrennial Games.\\nThe épéeists had been scheduled to travel too, to the United Arab Emirates for another World Cup meet, but that event has been rescheduled to January.\\nZheng said overseas competitions remained a necessary focus even with a multisport extravaganza approaching at home.\\n“The international competitions remain our targets, and the National Games is only icing on the cake for us,” he said. “My yearly plan was always about the international season, and we didn’t even train specifically for the National Games.\\n“So we must focus on the international tournaments, because that’s what keeps our rankings. We always want to take part in as many tournaments overseas as possible … our main battlefield was not an internal war but those international competitions.”\\nHong Kong’s fencers will be allowed to practise at Kai Tak’s 10,000-seat arena on November 12 before it is closed for final preparations. After that, their task will be to turn the venue to their advantage.\\n“Everything is a double-edged sword – the water that keeps a ship afloat can also sink it,” Zheng said. “It’s only about your mindset.\\n“If you see [being at home] as motivation, then you’ll get excited. When you see it as pressure, you then carry that burden yourself.”\\nHong Kong’s previous appearances at the Games have produced one silver and five bronze medals in fencing between 2013 and 2021.\\nVivian Kong Man-wai, who retired after claiming Olympic gold last year, was the last to win an individual medal, pocketing épée bronze in Shaanxi four years ago. The men’s foilists have been the only Hong Kong team to reach the podium, collecting bronze in 2017 and 2021.\\n",

            "description": "Inside the cramped premises of Hong Kong Family Food, a two-dish-rice restaurant in Causeway Bay, 59-year-old Lo Hung-wan toils away serving up takeaway meals for her customers.\\n“It is very busy during the lunch rush; I won’t even bother to answer the phone during this period,” said Lo, one of the restaurant’s operators. “During those couple of hours, it feels like we are fighting a war.”\\nTwo-dish rice is a type of meal that allows diners to select two pre-cooked main dishes of their choice accompanied by a generous serving of rice – all for around HK$30 (US$3.70) or more.\\n\\nThe format became popular in Hong Kong during the Covid-19 pandemic when many residents turned to the cheaper takeaway option after the government banned restaurant dining after 6pm for more than four months.\\nIndustry insiders estimate that the number of such eateries has mushroomed from around 300 during the pandemic to roughly 1,000 in the city now, ramping up competition among them.\\nHong Kong Family Food, which downsized from a pandemic peak of three branches to only one, knows this all too well.\\nLo said that increased competition from other two-dish-rice restaurants was one of the reasons they closed their branches, along with changing consumption patterns and rising costs.\\n\\n\\nWhile the remaining branch in Causeway Bay made enough to break even, it was still facing headwinds with rising costs, strong rivalry from similar stores nearby and uncertainty about where future customers would come from, Lo said.\\nTo better compete and retain customers, Lo publishes an online menu of the meals they will prepare for the month to allow customers to place advance orders online and to promote seasonal dishes – such as lamb and glutinous rice in winter – to attract diners.\\nLo is not alone with her business struggle. Earlier, This This Rice, a two-dish rice chain which used to run 10 outlets at its peak, shut around half of them.\\nIn July, its outlet in Causeway Bay’s Jardine’s Bazaar and its company secretary were also sued by its landlord for at least HK$533,430, which represented three months’ worth of unpaid rent, rates and interest.\\nSimon Wong Ka-wo, president of the Hong Kong Federation of Restaurants and Related Trades, said that the competition among two-dish-rice restaurants had increased with the influx of such eateries to the market in recent years.\\nHe attributed their rise to factors such as cheaper rent following the pandemic, the simplicity of setting up these eateries and the ease of expansion through franchising.\\n\\nHowever, Wong said he did not believe that the market was oversaturated with these restaurants. Instead, the market was currently undergoing consolidation, under which weaker businesses would be weeded out while stronger ones remained, he said.\\n“With the appearance of two-dish-rice restaurants in every district, I may see one street that will have two to three two-dish-rice restaurants. This shows that there is heavy competition,” he said.\\n“If the person beside you does better than you, then you will lose. If you keep losing money like this, then it will be hard for you to keep operating.”\\nWong suggested that if operators wanted to keep their businesses afloat, they would have to come up with different ideas to help set them apart from others.\\n“For instance, everyone is talking about health these days,” he said. “If operators provided healthy alternatives, they may have another market to attract customers who are health-conscious.”\\n",

I swallowed the gold.”\\nHe added that he had done so after trying “to exercise the strength of his tongue”.\\nAt first, Ji thought he was joking. But after confirming the gold bean was indeed gone, she was both amused and worried.\\nHowever, she did not want to handle the predicament at home.\\n“My niece once swallowed a coin,” Ji told the Dawan News.\\n\\n“When we took her to the hospital, the doctor said it was not a big deal and that she would pass it in her stool. So when this happened, I looked it up and saw that gold can also be passed the same way, so I did not take it too seriously,” she added.\\nHoping to recover the “lost treasure”, every day Ji told her son not to relieve himself outside because his “poop is too expensive”.\\nHowever, even after five consecutive days of checking his faeces twice daily, she still could not find the gold.\\nOn October 26, Ji took her son to the Fifth People’s Hospital in Kunshan.\\nAn examination found a “foreign object in the stomach”, but fortunately, the boy showed no signs of abdominal pain or vomiting.\\nLater the same day, the gold was successfully retrieved. It is unclear whether it was expelled naturally or through medical intervention.\\n\\n“Please make sure to store your gold properly and never let naughty children see it,” the mother warned.\\nAfter the relieved mother shared the details online, the story quickly went viral, attracted more than 500,000 views and caused much amusement.\\nOne online observer said: “They should have gone to the hospital immediately.

            "description": "In a bustling Bangkok market, hundreds of wholesale vendors have been selling black clothing since dawn – several with hefty discounts – in honour of Thailand’s late former queen.\\nRows of black T-shirts at a small stall hang near a banner reading “black shirts 40 baht” – a fraction of the usual price of 200 to 500 baht (US$6 to US$15) – drawing a steady stream of shoppers.\\n“We sell at this price so all Thais can wear black to pay respect to the queen mother,” said the business’s owner, Thanachote Siripadungdech, who launched the promotion shortly after the palace announced former queen Sirikit’s death.\\nSirikit, the mother of King Maha Vajiralongkorn, died on Friday last week at the age of 93.\\n\\nThe royal family holds a central place in Thai society, with portraits of its members seen in homes, offices and public spaces across the country.\\nSince Sirikit’s death, the government has declared a year-long mourning period for officials and urged the public to wear traditional Thai mourning colours of black or white for 90 days.\\nThe commerce ministry also has warned businesses against price gouging and set up a hotline for complaints.\\nSome clothing stores in shopping malls and wholesale vendors have switched their stock to sombre hues, seeking to capitalise on the nation’s grief.\\nBut Thanachote, 53, said he had lost a significant sum in the past week by selling shirts at least 100 baht a piece below cost.\\n“I am stable in life now and I have no debts so selling at a loss is fine by me,” he said.\\n“I just want to do something for the queen mother and the royal family,” added the vendor, dressed head to toe in black while fielding calls from suppliers in Thailand and China.\\n“They had worked so hard for Thailand. Now it’s my time to pay back.”\\n\\n\\nThanachote said he was giving away 200 shirts to senior citizens and low-income families.\\nNupap Khiaochaiyaphum, a 57-year-old farmer from northeastern Khon Kaen province, said she was grateful for the two free black polo shirts she got from his stall.\\n“I have black shirts back in my hometown, but not here [in Bangkok],” she said. “I love the monarchy so I will wear this to mourn the queen mother.”\\n‘Institutional observance’\\nAt another stall nearby, vendor Anut Pormsri and his assistant sat scrolling on their phones beneath a sign offering two black shirts for 100 baht.\\nHe said sales have plummeted compared to past royal mourning periods. “I used to sell a lot more. Now I am selling at a loss and hardly get any customers.”\\nHe said the low prices were both “a tribute and a clearance [discount]“ on a large backstock of black shirts emblazoned with the Thai character for number nine which were made to mourn the late king Bhumibol Adulyadej, known as “Rama IX”.\\n\\nWhen Bhumibol, King Vajiralongkorn’s father and one of the world’s longest-reigning monarchs, died in 2016, the country observed a full year of mourning.\\nAt another stall, shop worker Chit Sopheak was selling shirts in various colours, including black, at regular prices, starting from 199 baht.\\nHe also said sales had dropped this year, and had recently only sold around 50 shirts a day, compared to up to 400 daily during the previous royal mourning period.\\n“There is competition from online vendors,” he said. “The economy also isn’t good now.”\\nAnalyst Pavin Chachavalpongpun, a former Thai diplomat and academic who studies the monarchy, noted a difference between the public mourning for Sirikit and the grief expressed for the late king, calling it “the clearest measure of how drastically Thailand’s political landscape has shifted”.\\n\\n“Older generations and state employees maintain dutiful compliance – observing government mandates for black attire and periods of official grief,” he said.\\nBut the national mood in the past week has reflected “institutional observance” more than “organic, profound sorrow”, according to Pavin.\\nSome vendors said their discounts were meant to express their personal appreciation and respect for the royal family.\\n“I am thankful to be born in their majesties’ era,” said Thanachote. “I wasn’t born rich, but this kingdom gave me the chance to prosper.”\\n",

            "description": "In October 2025, United States President Donald Trump initiated the demolition of the East Wing of the White House to make way for a grand new ballroom, making it the largest alteration to the presidential complex in decades.\\nTrump said the new ballroom, privately funded at an estimated cost of US$250 million, would serve as a venue for “state events worthy of America’s greatness”.\\nThe demolition has provoked fierce controversy.\\nPreservationists, historians and members of Congress condemned the move as an act of vandalism against a national landmark. The National Trust for Historic Preservation warned that the new structure would “overwhelm” the historic core of the White House, while critics accused Trump of bypassing required planning and review procedures.\\nSupporters, however, praised the project as a privately funded modernisation that would leave an enduring architectural legacy.\\nTrump’s architectural adventure fits neatly into a long lineage of rulers bewitched by spectacle. No present-day politician has so instinctively grasped the power of showmanship – the choreographed signing ceremonies, the gilded interiors, the capitalised superlatives.\\nFor Trump, grandeur is not mere ornament but proof of authority, a physical manifestation of success and dominance.\\n\\nHis proposed White House ballroom, like his gold towers and military parades, is the latest expression of his lifelong pursuit of flummery. His aesthetic of excess is designed to dazzle followers and confound critics. In this, he joins the emperors of old, for whom magnificence was inseparable from the performance of power.\\nThey were the showmen of empire: the First Emperor of the Qin dynasty, Emperor Yang of the Sui dynasty and the Ming dynasty’s Jiajing Emperor. These were rulers whose craving for grandeur reshaped China’s landscape and imagination.\\nTheir monuments were dazzling in scale yet perilous in consequence, reminders that when public works lose touch with political reality, they risk becoming monuments to folly as much as to glory.\\nThe First Emperor, Qin Shi Huang, remains inseparable from monumental ambition. After unifying the warring states in 221BC, he ordered the expansion and joining of separate frontier walls that became the Great Wall, as well as the construction of vast palaces and a tomb complex guarded by the famous terracotta army.\\nThe achievement was staggering. These projects bound the new empire together and laid the foundations for China’s bureaucratic state. Yet they were sustained by forced labour, crushing taxes and pitiless punishments. Within three years of his death, rebellion swept away the Qin, proof that even the most formidable walls and palaces cannot defend a ruler from the resentment of his people.\\nEight centuries later, Emperor Yang repeated the pattern with spectacular ambition. His Grand Canal, linking the fertile Yangtze basin with the north, remains one of the world’s great engineering feats. It revolutionised the transport of grain and troops and stitched north and south together into a single economic system.\\n\\nBut the cost, in blood and silver, was ruinous. Hundreds of thousands were conscripted for the construction of the Grand Canal and other projects. Rebellion followed, and the Sui dynasty collapsed after barely four decades of its founding.\\nThe Jiajing Emperor channelled his vanity into stone rather than canals. Obsessed with Taoism and the afterlife, he ordered the construction of an enormous tomb complex, the “Eternal Mausoleum”, for himself. Officials protested the waste, the treasury emptied and the dynasty’s fiscal strains deepened.\\nThese were just three Chinese emperors with a penchant for building grand monuments. There were many others across the millennia. These rulers left China with architectural marvels, but also political lessons. Great architectural and engineering works can unite nations and inspire generations, yet when conceived in hubris, they drain the state and alienate the governed.\\nWhile Trump’s ballroom is privately funded – thus sparing taxpayers the burdens once imposed by China’s emperors – its legacy will ensure that generations of Americans must live with his vision and aesthetic tastes, grafted onto the symbolic heart of the republic.\\n",

            "description": "Beneath hills draped in ancient rainforests, where rivers sustain millions and biodiversity flourishes, Southeast Asia hides a treasure coveted by global superpowers: rare earth elements.\\nThese minerals – neodymium, dysprosium and yttrium, to name just a few – form the backbone of modern technology, powering everything from smartphones and electric vehicles to MRI scanners and missile guidance systems.\\nAs much as one-fifth of the world’s untapped rare earth deposits are thought to nestle within the region, promising untold billions to whoever can extract and process them for a market hungry for the resources fuelling artificial intelligence, defence manufacturing and the world’s energy transition.\\nChina, long the dominant player in rare earth extraction and processing, has increasingly turned to neighbouring Laos and Myanmar in search of additional deposits.

Donald Trump was all smiles when he arrived at the Association of Southeast Asian Nations summit last weekend, but behind the scenes the US president wielded the threat of tariffs to pressure export-driven Asean economies into aligning with Washington’s agenda.\\nHe departed with a clutch of trade agreements as well as the optics of a “peace deal” extending a ceasefire along a border that Cambodia and Thailand have bickered over for decades.\\nMore consequentially, he secured two memorandums of understanding (MOUs) with Thailand and Malaysia granting US companies preferential access to any newly discovered rare earth deposits, with both nations agreeing to offer American firms the first opportunity to invest, extract or purchase these resources at market rates.\\nWe no longer want to be a country that only digs and ships out cheap raw materials like in the past\\nTengku Zafrul Aziz, Malaysia’s trade minister\\nIn Malaysia’s case, an additional clause explicitly prohibits export restrictions or quotas, raising eyebrows among environmentalists and trade analysts in a country that only last year imposed a ban on raw rare earth exports to promote domestic refining and value-added industries.\\nBoth agreements include a vague provision to “review and deter certain critical minerals and rare earths asset sales on national security grounds” – with Beijing, Washington’s strategic rival, the presumed target.\\nDenials and unease\\nThe White House says neither agreement is legally binding and may be revoked by mutual consent, but scepticism abounds that Trump’s America would ever willingly relinquish any leverage.\\nAs unease rippled through Thailand and Malaysia over the hastily signed pacts – and the uncertain value of the resources in play – both governments moved to allay fears of a sell-off of strategic national assets.\\n\\n“We no longer want to be a country that only digs and ships out cheap raw materials like in the past,” Malaysian Trade Minister Tengku Zafrul Aziz told parliament this week, reaffirming the export ban and outlining a policy to attract foreign investment and technology for domestic extraction and processing.\\n“Our policy is not to prevent trade forever,” he said. “Our policy is to prevent the export of cheap unprocessed raw materials so that value is added to Malaysia.”\\nMalaysia is simultaneously negotiating with China on rare earth processing, according to a recent Reuters report, with its sovereign wealth fund Khazanah Nasional said to be in talks with Chinese firms about building a refinery.\\nPrime Minister Anwar Ibrahim, under fire for his apparent capitulation to Washington’s demands, insisted there was no provision in the memorandum “that cancels or prohibits” sharing rare earths with other countries.\\n\\nThai officials have also been on the defensive. “This is not a binding treaty,” Thailand’s Industry Minister Thanakorn Wangboonkongchana said on Thursday.\\n“Should any investment take place in Thailand, investors will be required to comply with Thai laws”, he added, citing environmental and public health assessments.\\nThailand’s government has said it sees the US agreement as a long-term opportunity to build expertise in rare earths and expand its presence in the global supply chain, while having little impact on ties with China, its biggest trading partner.\\nStill, fundamental questions remain. Who truly stands to benefit from this new resource rush? How can extraction be managed safely, given the toxic processes involved? And, if necessary, how can Malaysia and Thailand extricate themselves from agreements with the world’s pre-eminent superpower?\\n“These are the nation’s resources, not bargaining chips for hidden political or economic deals,” said Phattarapong Leelaphat, an opposition lawmaker from Chiang Mai, adding that terminating the deal with a country “that holds multiple leverage points over us is no simple matter”.\\n\\nEcological costs\\nChina controls an estimated 60-70 per cent of global rare earth deposits, but Southeast Asia holds up to 20 per cent of known reserves, according to the Australian Strategic Policy Institute.\\nMost of these are in Vietnam, with about 3.5 million tonnes, and Myanmar, whose rare earth exports to China were valued at more than US$4.2 billion between 2017 and 2024, according to figures from the US Geological Survey and Washington-based Stimson Centre think tank.\\nEnvironmentalists warn that Myanmar’s experience stands as a cautionary tale. Mining operations, particularly those in Kachin and Shan states, have left deep scars in the landscape, with toxins seeping into soils and rivers across borders. Pollution from 19 militia-controlled sites in Shan state turned the Kok River orange earlier this year, with arsenic levels soaring in the Mekong tributary that flows through northern Thailand.\\nSatellite imagery revealed sprawling “leaching pools” filled with chemicals designed to flush rare earths from rock. Other solvents are used to separate minerals embedded in the same ore, sometimes with devastating ecological consequences.\\n\\nIn Thailand, government surveys indicate rare earth deposits run from Chiang Mai in the north through Mae Hong Son and Kanchanaburi down to Ranong and Surat Thani in the south. Yet even as US miners eye these resources, the pollution in the north of the country has made clear the risks posed by unregulated, or hastily regulated, extraction.\\n“Thailand cannot realistically invest in rare earth mining in the US, because extraction there is far more expensive,” Phattarapong, the opposition MP, said in an open letter earlier this week.\\n“The government must not approve any domestic rare earth mining operations or allow the US to use this MOU to pressure Thailand into opening up its own mines,” he added, urging the government to conduct comprehensive research and establish strong legal frameworks were in place to prevent environmental disaster.\\nWith billions at stake, Southeast Asian governments are racing to tighten oversight of their rare earth sectors. In Indonesia, authorities created a dedicated ministry this year to regulate the industry, after unchecked nickel mining for electric vehicle batteries damaged coral reefs and excluded indigenous communities from the benefits of their land’s resources.\\nMeanwhile in Laos, calls for stricter controls are intensifying after satellite images exposed dozens of illegal rare earth mines, mostly run by Chinese operators, clustered along rivers and tributaries.\\n\\nForests in peril\\nMalaysia, with an estimated 16 million tonnes of rare earth deposits, has sought to harness its strategic assets for national gain.\\nSoutheast Asia’s only rare earth processing plant is located in the Malaysian state of Pahang. But the 140-hectare (347-acre) site, operated by Lynas Rare Earths, currently only refines ores mined in Australia.\\nAnwar’s government has vowed not to export raw rare earths, but the language of the US deal has cast doubt on this commitment.\\nConservationists warn that a rare earth rush could further deplete Malaysia’s remaining rainforests, with deposits hidden away beneath the rich ecosystems of Terengganu, Kelantan, Perak, Pahang and Kedah.\\n\\n“Our critical minerals are primarily in high-carbon-stock areas, essentially our forests,” said climate policy analyst Aidil Iman. “This decision will only drive more deforestation.”\\nMining is technically prohibited in so-called Permanent Forest Reserves under Malaysia’s National Forestry Act, but Aidil warned that surging demand might tempt state governments to strip protected lands of that status.\\nMalaysia’s New Industrial Master Plan 2030, designed to propel advanced manufacturing and green industries, envisions the rare earth sector drawing investments of up to 100 billion ringgit (US$24 billion) and creating about 4,000 jobs.\\nAbout 144,000 hectares (356,000 acres) outside forest reserves had been identified for potential mining, acting natural resources minister Johari Abdul Ghani recently told parliament – though he said all projects would require environmental assessments and monitoring by the Forest Research Institute Malaysia.\\n\\nHe added that one pilot site in Gerik, Perak, was already using “in situ leaching technology” from China – a method that uses chemicals to flush rare earths from the soil rather than excavating them.\\nConcerns persist that existing laws are too weak, or too easily flouted, to safeguard against environmental abuse. In Kedah and Perak, illegal rare earth mining in 2022 left behind toxic waste and stripped riverbanks of their biodiversity.\\nThe Environmental Quality Act of 1974 remains Malaysia’s main environmental statute, but critics contend its penalties and enforcement are inadequate to address the scale and complexity of modern rare earth mining.\\nAdam Farhan, co-founder of ecological watchdog RimbaWatch, called the law “outdated and too business-friendly to prevent extractive damage”.\\nIt’s extremely concerning that Malaysia is signing away its sovereign right to regulate minerals\\nAdam Farhan, environmentalist\\n“It’s extremely concerning that Malaysia is signing away its sovereign right to regulate minerals,” he said.\\nRenard Siew, a climate adviser at the Centre for Governance and Political Studies in Kuala Lumpur, said that the memorandum with Washington “shouldn’t be treated as a green light to expand mining unchecked”.\\n“Responsible extraction must include proper environmental and social impact assessments, free and informed community consent, rehabilitation of mined areas and cleaner technologies,” he said.\\nThe government insists that the “dig and dump” era of Malaysia’s extractive industries is long past, but experts warn the country risks too much by courting Trump’s White House.\\n“While Malaysia may be rich in these rare earth resources vital for the global clean energy transition, we should not be pressured by external demands or swayed by short-term economic gains at the cost of environmental damage,” Randolph Jeremiah, vice-president of the Environmental Protection Society Malaysia, told This Week in Asia.\\n“We need to retain full control over these resources, ensuring their exploitation is sustainable and that benefits are equitably secured for the nation in the long term.”\\n",

            "description": "US President Donald Trump said on Friday that he had renovated the Lincoln Bedroom’s bathroom, putting his latest stamp on the White House after demolishing the East Wing, paving over the Rose Garden and decorating the Oval Office in gold.\\nTrump, who has drawn criticism from preservationists and Democrats for adding a Mar-a-Lago-style sheen to the historic mansion, unveiled the remodelled white-and-black-marbled bathroom via social media.\\n“I renovated the Lincoln Bathroom in the White House. It was renovated in the 1940s in an art deco green tile style, which was totally inappropriate for the Lincoln Era,” Trump said in his post, which included photos of the bathroom before and after the renovation.\\n“I did it in black and white polished Statuary marble,” he said. “This was very appropriate for the time of Abraham Lincoln and, in fact, could be the marble that was originally there!”\\nThe White House did not immediately respond to questions about whether the bathroom project had undergone any formal design or approval process.\\n\\nTrump’s abrupt demolition of the East Wing this month to make way for a 8,360-square-metre (90,000-square-foot) ballroom has been criticised for not first going through a proper review.\\nThe White House has said it would submit plans for the ballroom construction for review by the National Capital Planning Commission, which is chaired by Trump’s staff secretary.\\nWhile US presidents over the decades have remodelled rooms in their living space, Trump, a former New York real estate tycoon, has sought to remake the White House with particular gusto.\\nSince taking office in January, Trump has put gold adornments and statuettes in the Oval Office, in a style he prefers. The grass in the Rose Garden was dug up and paved over with white stone.\\nPortraits of Trump have been hung throughout the property, and giant American flags erected on new flagpoles on the north and south lawns.\\nThe green-tiled Lincoln bathroom dated back to a White House renovation conducted by then-President Harry Truman in the 1950s, according to a Washington Post article from 2007.\\nAt the time, then-President George W. Bush and first lady Laura Bush undertook a renovation of the Lincoln Bedroom, which Lincoln used as an office. The Post article describing the Bush renovation said they had left alone the “well-preserved” bathroom.\\n",

            "description": "Arooj Aftab became the first Pakistani Grammy winner when she took home the global music performance award for her song “Mohabbat” in 2022.\\nA year later, actor and singer Diljit Dosanjh stepped onto the smoke-filled stage of the Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival in Southern California, becoming the festival’s first artist from the Indian state of Punjab.\\nIn August, the first-generation Indian-American artist Avara sat in a bed of rose petals at a concert hall in Brooklyn, New York, for the opening performance of her first tour. Fans crowded around the stage for a glimpse of the artist, who has gained over 250,000 new monthly Spotify listeners since November 2024 – a more than 250 per cent increase.\\n“I started getting a bunch of her TikToks,” said audience member Alex Kim, a 22-year-old music assistant. “Everyone has a short attention span these days, but I was like, ‘Wait a minute, I actually really like this.’”\\nFollowing Afrobeat, K-pop and Latin music, songs with South Asian influences are the latest global trend around the world. In April, Warner Music Group launched 5 Junction Records, a label dedicated to selling South Asian-influenced artists to North American listeners.\\n“It’s something that’s been forming slowly,” Billboard CEO Mike Van said about the overseas surge of South Asian-influenced artists. “We started to see these growth spurts over the last couple of years because of all the technology, evolving tastes and activation of these diaspora audiences.”\\n\\nJuergen Grebner, the general manager of 5 Junction Records, said that his label looks for artists with strong fan bases in their home countries. A No 1 song in India “automatically will chart in the Top 20 on Spotify’s global charts”, he said.\\nBorn to Moroccan parents in Toronto, Canada, actress-turned-singer Nora Fatehi performed at the Fifa World Cup 2022, and billions worldwide watched the closing ceremony in Qatar. A Toronto talent agency had encouraged her to explore opportunities in India, and she moved there 11 years ago, learned Hindi and began auditioning for every modelling and acting role she could find, determined to make a name for herself.\\n“The Indian audience is the reason why I am what I am today. So while I’m making myself into a global artist, I’m bringing them with me,” Fatehi said.\\nIn the multibillion-dollar global music business, musicians often need to team up with local artists or brands to expand beyond their popularity at home, Grebner said.\\n“The only way really to win in those markets is to collaborate,” he said.\\nThe international girl group Katseye features members of Indian, Japanese and Filipino descent who starred in a recent Gap advertisement.\\nFatehi’s single “Snake”, featuring US pop and R&amp;B singer Jason Derulo, reached the top 20 on Spotify charts in both the UK and Canada.\\n\\n\\nSome music from India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Nepal, Bhutan, Sri Lanka and the Maldives evolved as a way to teach Buddhism, Hinduism, Sikhism and other spiritual teachings thousands of years ago, said Professor Francesca Cassio, chair of the music department at Hofstra University in New York. One North Indian classical genre, khyal, gained popularity in the West during the 1960s as sitar great Ravi Shankar influenced musicians, including the Beatles and John Coltrane.\\nAs the US becomes increasingly diverse, it has been encouraging to see younger audiences showing an “overall acceptance of global sounds”, Van said.\\nVan pointed out that Gen Z and Gen Alpha are leading the charge in embracing music that crosses cultural lines.\\n“Artists have a direct connection now to their fans,” said Van. “You’ve got clips now, literally edited down to 10 seconds or less, that are capturing people’s attention that can go viral. And so it’s a new way of not only promotion, but also again, consumption and discovery.”\\n\\nAvara gained a social media following by posting videos that blend her meditative R&amp;B and soul music with elements of her years of Indian classical and Western vocal training.\\nIn Marietta, in the US state of Georgia, she grew up feeling “never a part of the brown community but never completely a part of the American community”, she said.\\n“I was around a lot of white people and people that didn’t look like me, and I rejected a lot of parts of myself,” she said.\\nHer debut album, a softer place to land, honoured the artistic community that shaped her over the past two years. Her next project, Mara, is about reclaiming her identity as a “young brown girl” through the lens of a “third-culture kid” – someone who grows up balancing their parents’ heritage with the cultures they are raised in, she said.\\nShe described her next album as a mixture of every culture that has influenced her over the past 25 years, blending Indian vocal riffs with Spanish guitar, reggae and other styles.\\n“I’m trying to create something completely different,” she said. “I’m trying to create a new genre with this stuff that comes from those influences of what I learned as a kid.”\\n",
