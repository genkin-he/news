            "description": "Hong Kong patients enrolled in government subsidised healthcare services will be able to buy medicines under a specific list of drugs at prices much lower than market rates when a new initiative launches late next year.\\nThe Health Bureau also said on Thursday that the Community Pharmacy Programme, set to launch in the fourth quarter of 2026, would first roll out in four districts – Eastern District, Yau Tsim Mong, Sha Tin and Yuen Long.\\nThe Community Drug Formulary – a list of drugs commonly used in primary healthcare, such as those for prevention and managing chronic diseases – would be introduced in the second half of next year.\\n“To promote the development of primary healthcare and ease the burden on the public healthcare system, we believe the Community Drug Formulary will play a useful role,” said Dr Cheung Wai-lun, director of the bureau’s Strategic Purchasing Office.\\nThe idea of developing a community drug formulary and pharmacy programme was first proposed in last year’s policy address, with the aim of giving people access to more affordable primary healthcare drugs.\\nPatients enrolled in the Chronic Disease Co-Care Pilot Scheme and other primary healthcare services would be able to buy medications listed under the formulary through participating family doctors or community pharmacies.\\n\\nCommissioner for primary healthcare Dr Pang Fei-chau said the formulary would also cover medications used in women’s and elderly health services.\\nDrugs listed under the formulary, mainly selected from the Hospital Authority Drug Formulary and procured by the authority, would be grouped into three tiers.\\nTier one would be non-patented drugs, which would take up 80 to 90 per cent of total medications on the list.\\nTier two would cover patented and specified drugs, and third tier would cover drugs classified as “special category” which the authorities did not elaborate on.\\nAll the medicines would be provided under a co-payment model, requiring patients to pay a certain amount.\\nCheung said the authorities had yet to decide on the co-payment amount, which would be announced around the middle of next year.\\n“The [co-payment amount] would certainly be at an affordable level, and a lot cheaper than the market price,” he said.\\nPatient contributions for tier-one drugs would be determined by the type of drugs and the dispensing period, while the cost for tier-two medications would be determined by both type and usage.\\nThe formulary would initially include more than 100 drugs, with plans to expand to between 200 and 400 types of medications in the long term.\\nThe Community Pharmacy Programme would operate under two service models.\\nIn the first model, the pharmacies would serve patients from public family medicine clinics, who could request refills if they had exhausted the eight-week supply provided by those clinics.\\nPatients enrolled in the government’s primary healthcare programmes who prefer to obtain medications outside their family doctors’ clinics could also visit those pharmacies.\\nThe second model targets residential care homes, where the pharmacies would prepack and deliver drugs monthly for residents who are public hospital patients.\\nprint cut starts\\nPublic hospital patients using the community pharmacies would pay the same fees stipulated by the Hospital Authority, while those under the government’s primary healthcare programmes will be charged the co-payments set by the formulary.\\nMeanwhile, the authorities on Thursday launched the Guidelines of Practice for Community Pharmacy, providing standards across four key areas: management and staff, premises requirements, daily operation procedures and scope of services.\\n",

            "description": "Israeli planes and tanks pounded areas in eastern Gaza on Thursday, Palestinian residents and witnesses said, a day after Israel said it remained committed to a US-backed ceasefire despite launching more lethal bombardments in the territory.\\nWitnesses said Israeli planes carried out 10 air strikes in areas east of Khan Younis in the southern Gaza Strip, while tanks shelled areas east of Gaza City in the north. No injuries or deaths were reported.\\nThe Israeli military said it carried out “precise” strikes against “terrorist infrastructure that posed a threat to the troops” in the areas, which Israel still occupies.\\nThe strikes were the latest test of the fragile ceasefire that came into effect on October 10, in the conflict between Israel and Hamas.\\n“We’re scared that another war will break out, because we don’t want a war. We’ve suffered two years of displacement. We don’t know where to go or where to come,” said a displaced man, Fathi Al-Najjar, in Khan Younis in southern Gaza.\\nAt the tent encampment where Najjar spoke, girls and boys were filling plastic bottles with water from metal containers placed on the side of the street, and women cooked food for their families using clay-made firewood ovens.\\n\\nReturn of deceased hostages\\nUnder the ceasefire accord, Hamas released all living hostages in return for nearly 2,000 Palestinian prisoners and wartime detainees, while Israel pulled back its troops and agreed to halt its offensive.\\nHamas also agreed to hand over the remains of all 28 dead hostages. It has returned 15 bodies, arguing that it will take time to locate and retrieve all of them.\\nThe militant group’s armed wing announced on Thursday that it would hand over two more bodies of hostages.\\nThe recovery and handover of bodies of hostages in Gaza has been one of the obstacles to US President Donald Trump’s Gaza plan, with Israel claiming that Hamas has been delaying the handover, an accusation Hamas denies.\\n\\nGaza officials say women and children killed\\nFrom Tuesday into Wednesday, Israel retaliated for the death of an Israeli soldier with bombardments that Gaza health authorities said killed 104 people.\\nWitnesses in Gaza said they did not see strikes on Thursday outside the area Israel controls.\\nIsrael said the soldier was killed in an attack by gunmen on territory within the so-called “yellow line” to which its troops withdrew under the ceasefire. Hamas has rejected the accusation.\\nThe Israeli military issued a list of 26 militants it said it had targeted during the bombardment earlier this week, including one it said was a Hamas commander who took part in the October 7, 2023 assault on Israel that ignited the war.\\nThe Hamas-run Gaza government media office said Israel’s list was part of a “systematic campaign of misinformation” to cover up “crimes against civilians in Gaza”.\\nThe Gaza health ministry said 46 children and 20 women were among the 104 people killed in the air strikes.\\nSources close to international efforts to sustain the ceasefire said US and regional mediators swiftly intervened to restore calm as Israel and Hamas traded blame.\\n\\nStrikes raise ceasefire doubts\\nPeople in the Gaza Strip, most of which had been reduced to wasteland, feared the tenuous truce would fall apart, saying that the last two days, in which they were deprived of sleep, felt like a revival of the two-year war.\\n“The situation is extremely difficult. The war is still ongoing, and we have no hope that it will end, because of the conditions we are witnessing in the life we are living,” said Mohammed Al-Sheikh.\\nThe war has displaced most of Gaza’s more than two million people, some of them several times. Many haven’t yet returned to their areas, fearing they could soon be displaced once again.\\nGaza health authorities said more than 68,000 people have been killed in the Israeli campaign and thousands more are missing. Israel launched the war after Hamas-led fighters attacked southern Israel, killing 1,200 people and bringing 251 hostages back to Gaza, according to Israeli tallies.\\n",

            "description": "The Dutch government is under renewed pressure to end its seizure of the Chinese-owned, Netherlands-based semiconductor company Nexperia, after Washington agreed to suspend its updated export control rule for one year.\\nAfter a meeting between Chinese President Xi Jinping and his US counterpart Donald Trump on Thursday, China’s Ministry of Commerce said Washington would temporarily halt the implementation of its so-called 50 per cent subsidiary rule.\\nIntroduced in late September, that rule expanded US export restrictions to any company that was at least 50 per cent owned by entities on Washington’s trade blacklist.\\nThe one-year suspension is expected to complicate the geopolitical dispute surrounding Nexperia, a critical supplier of semiconductors with automotive, industrial, mobile and consumer applications.\\nThe Dutch government’s action, which included the ousting of Nexperia CEO Zhang Xuezheng, was partly a reaction to the anticipated effects of the new US rule.\\n\\n“China has found effective means to counterbalance relevant US policies”, said Zhang Guobin, founder of Chinese chip industry news website eetrend.com, referring to Beijing’s suspension of a set of new rare earth export controls unveiled in October.\\nWhile the suspension of the 50 per cent subsidiary rule “cannot automatically undo the legal grounds for the Dutch intervention” in Nexperia, it did provide a crucial one-year window for its Chinese owner Wingtech Technology to mitigate the likelihood of an eventual mandatory divestment, according to Bai Wenxi, vice-chairman of China Enterprise Capital Union.\\nGary Ng, senior economist at Natixis Corporate and Investment Bank, agreed that the suspension of the 50 per cent rule removed the urgency for the Dutch government to pressure Nexperia for changes.\\nStill, in the worst-case scenario, there could be shareholding changes alongside supply chain reshuffling, making it difficult to predict the situation a year from now, Ng said.\\nDutch authorities seized control of Nexperia on September 30 by invoking the obscure 1952 Goods Availability Act, a day after the US announced its 50 per cent rule. Since Nexperia is wholly owned by the blacklisted Wingtech, it fell under US sanctions.\\nWhile the Netherlands cited mismanagement by Zhang as the official reason for the takeover, the unusual move reflects Europe’s increasingly precarious position amid the US-China rivalry.\\n“The Hague acted as if constrained by necessity, yet that necessity has now vanished with a single comment from Trump,” said Sebastian Contin Trillo-Figueroa, geopolitics analyst and AsiaGlobal Fellow at the University of Hong Kong.\\n“The Netherlands faces a complex dilemma between legal consistency, political credibility, and industrial survival.”\\nThe Netherlands seized control of Nexperia on September 30 by invoking the obscure 1952 Goods Availability Act, a day after the US announced its 50 per cent rule.

            "description": "Hong Kong could face a higher risk of chikungunya fever spreading during the coming National Games as an outbreak across the border had yet to be brought under control, a leading infectious disease expert warned on Thursday, calling on the city to take preventive measures.\\nProfessor Jasper Chan Fuk-woo, of the University of Hong Kong’s department of microbiology, said that while the situation had improved compared with a peak in infections recorded earlier in mainland China, chikungunya transmissions in Guangdong province had not been brought under control.\\nHe said the University of Hong Kong-Shenzhen Hospital frequently received cases of chikungunya infections, including locally acquired ones and those infected elsewhere.\\n“There was a period when the situation was very serious, with hundreds or even more cases reported every day. The situation is gradually being controlled but it is not yet completely under control, which will take time,” he told the Post.\\nChan said Hong Kong would face risks of transmissions of the mosquito-borne disease during the National Games to be co-hosted by the city, Guangdong and Macau from November 9 to 21.\\n“With the increased traffic flow between the mainland cities of the Greater Bay Area and Hong Kong and more frequent trips of Hongkongers to other cities within the bay area, the risks will inevitably become higher,” he said.\\n“We don’t see a large-scale outbreak in the foreseeable future, but we must be careful because this is a major event.”\\n\\n\\nChan said the local control of transmissions and the measures taken by athletes and spectators to protect themselves were important.\\nHe urged the city to take measures to prevent the viral disease from spreading, including investigating local cases and controlling infections.\\nChan noted that compared with some other mosquito-borne diseases which were asymptomatic, at least two-thirds of chikungunya fever patients developed symptoms such as fever as well as muscle and joint pain.\\nHe called on residents as well as cross-border travellers with symptoms to seek medical attention and get tested as soon as possible, which he said could help control transmissions.\\nChikungunya fever is a viral disease transmitted by the Aedes aegypti mosquito, with an incubation period of about two to 12 days. Although rarely fatal, it can cause fever, rash and joint pain.\\nAuthorities urged residents to use insect repellents containing DEET or other active ingredients effective against mosquitoes and seek medical advice promptly if they developed relevant symptoms.\\n\\nDespite Chan’s warning, another infectious disease specialist, Dr Wilson Lam Wai-shun, dismissed such concerns as the temperature was dropping gradually.\\nBut he suggested visitors from Guangdong take preventive measures against mosquitoes during the Games.\\n“The weather will be cooler by then and there will be fewer mosquitoes. The risk of chikungunya fever transmissions will be lower in both Guangdong and Hong Kong,” he said, adding that the disease was not transmitted from human to human.\\nHe added that the risks during the Games would be lower than they were during the National Day “golden week” holiday earlier this month, when traffic flow was heavier and the weather was hotter.\\nAuthorities have been on high alert after an 82-year-old woman living in Fung Tak Estate in Diamond Hill became the city’s first locally acquired case when she was diagnosed last Thursday.\\nChief Executive John Lee Ka-chiu on Tuesday pledged to make every effort to eliminate mosquitoes to ensure that the disease did not take root locally.\\nLee pointed to government efforts, including intensive mosquito control and the removal of stagnant water within a 250-metre (820-foot) radius of the woman’s home, as well as inspections of high-risk areas such as construction sites.\\nAs of Thursday, the city had recorded 52 confirmed cases of chikungunya so far this year.\\n",

Revenue was 9.7 per cent lower than the average forecast of 215.9 billion yuan.\\n“Falling sales in China and discounts offered to spur deliveries in the home market have pressured BYD to improve its profitability,” said Ivan Li, a fund manager at Loyal Wealth Management in Shanghai. “Its robust sales abroad are not enough to offset its weak domestic performance.”\\nControlled by Chinese billionaire Wang Chuanfu, BYD delivered a total of 1.11 million pure electric and plug-in hybrid vehicles in the third quarter, down 1.8 per cent a year earlier and 2.7 per cent lower quarter on quarter.\\nThe results reflected how Chinese carmakers have continued to offer substantial discounts to mainland buyers to survive in the world’s largest vehicle market amid weak consumer spending and concerns about overcapacity.\\n\\nThe average EV discount reached a record 17.4 per cent in June, according to a report earlier this month from JPMorgan, which analysed data from 40 foreign and domestic car brands across 1,000 variants. The number fell to 16.7 per cent in July, but remained relatively stable since then.\\nChina’s vehicle output – including buses, lorries and passenger cars – could reach 33 million units this year, compared with an estimated production capacity of about 50 million, according to Nick Lai, head of car research for Asia-Pacific at JPMorgan.\\nIn contrast, BYD’s overseas deliveries surged 146 per cent to 232,806 units in the third quarter. The company forecast 800,000 to 1 million deliveries outside mainland China this year, compared with projected total sales of 4.6 million units, Li Yun, general manager of branding and public relations, said last month.\\nBYD expected exports to constitute about 20 per cent of its total sales this year, up from around 10 per cent in 2024.\\nLai noted that Chinese EV makers could enjoy profit margins of 20,000 yuan per unit abroad, four times higher than in the domestic market, on the back of better pricing overseas.\\nBYD last month recorded a sales jump in Europe after launching more models and expanding its sales network, narrowing the gap with market leader Tesla.\\nThe Chinese carmaker in September recorded 24,963 new car registrations in Europe, nearly five times the 5,013 units it sold a year ago, according to data from the European Automobile Manufacturers’ Association, which tracks car sales across the European Union, United Kingdom, Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland.\\n",

            "title": "After Xi-Trump talks, lack of semiconductor deal seen as tech-independence issue",
            "description": "Amid the apparent absence of a concrete deal being reached with Washington on one of Beijing’s long-standing points of trade contention – export controls on the most advanced semiconductors – analysts say it reflects China’s increasing resolve to become more independent from the US.\\nAfter a meeting with President Xi Jinping in South Korea on Thursday morning, US President Donald Trump said the two sides “did discuss chips”.\\n“China is going to be talking to Nvidia and others about taking chips … and I’ll be speaking to Jensen [Huang] from Nvidia,” Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One, referring to the world’s top chip designer and its CEO.\\n“I said that’s really between [China] and Nvidia, but we are sort of the arbitrator or the referee,” Trump added.\\nHis comments came as the two sides announced progress on other issues, including tariff reductions and pauses; rare earth export controls; agricultural purchases; and suspensions of port fees.\\nHowever, experts caution that these concessions should not be mistaken for fundamental shifts in the strategic rivalry between Washington and Beijing. Instead, they represent tactical moves by both sides to buy time and manage vulnerabilities, according to Junyu Tan, a regional economist for North Asia with credit insurance company Coface.\\n“For China, this means accelerating efforts to reduce its reliance on the US for advanced chip technologies,” Tan said.\\nWe’re seeing a big push and pull between the economic and security voices in the US administration\\nNick Marro, Economist Intelligence Unit\\nKnowing that the loosening of controls on semiconductors is a key ask from Beijing, Trump has shown a willingness to compromise on the issue, observed Nick Marro, principal economist for Asia and the lead for global trade at the Economist Intelligence Unit. But he added that the US national security establishment and Congress, across party lines, have been opposed to any easing in US policy.\\n“We’re seeing a big push and pull between the economic and security voices in the US administration,” he said. “The administration will have to strike a fine line balancing these competing views.”\\nBut all of this is now complicated by the fact that China is also becoming less restrained in the sector, Marro explained.\\n“For years, Chinese officials have issued guidance – both explicit and implicit – for local companies to cut American products out of their supply chains,” he said. “But now the message seems more urgent, and more forceful.”\\nThe Trump administration has vacillated on allowing Nvidia’s advanced chips into China, uncertain of whether it would create dependency or boost China’s military and tech sectors.\\nAfter briefly banning sales of Nvidia’s China-specific H20 AI chip, the US lifted the ban as part of rare earth negotiations in July.\\n\\n\\nLater, however, Chinese regulators reportedly ordered leading technology companies to halt purchases of those chips, with Beijing launching antitrust investigations into Nvidia while raising questions about security risks.\\nNvidia’s Huang said on Tuesday that his company had not applied for US export licences to send its newest chips to China, because of the Chinese position.\\n“They’ve made it very clear that they don’t want Nvidia to be there right now,” he said during the company’s developers’ event.\\nWang Dan, China director at Eurasia Group, said the 15th five-year plan that Beijing just formulated made it particularly clear that the country would focus on “original innovation”, meaning China realised that buying US chips was unsustainable and unreliable, even if short-term imports were possible and might address immediate needs.\\n“Therefore, China is now directing more resources towards achieving breakthroughs,” Wang said.\\nAs for negotiations with the US in the long run, China is also unlikely to make excessive concessions if the US temporarily relaxes chip-export controls at some point, she added.\\n“I don’t think China will entirely lift its rare earth controls just because the US rolls back a small portion of its chip restrictions.”\\n",
