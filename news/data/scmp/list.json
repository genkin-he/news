            "title": "Cathay passengers bemoan refund policies as US, Israel exchange strikes with Iran",
            "description": "Passengers flying with Hong Kong’s Cathay Pacific Airways have criticised the flag carrier over its compensation and rebooking policies after flights to the Middle East were cancelled due to the joint United States-Israeli attack on Iran.\nCathay Pacific said on Sunday that it was “waiving rebooking and re-routing charges for the affected customers” to give them “greater flexibility”, but did not clarify whether the measures included financial compensation for conflict-related cancellations or delays.\nA reporter from the South China Morning Post spoke with stranded travellers at Hong Kong International Airport as they dealt with disrupted journeys. Many of the affected flights were to Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, and Dubai, United Arab Emirates (UAE).\nAmong them was a 36-year-old man who gave his name as Yan. The traveller from Wuhan was left bargaining with staff at Cathay’s service counters.\nYan, who has worked in Riyadh for five years, said he had been stranded since Saturday after his flight to the Saudi capital was cancelled.\nHe said his repeated calls to the airline’s customer service hotline had gone unanswered.\nAfter speaking to Cathay staff at the airport, he was told that the next available flight to Riyadh had been provisionally scheduled for seven days later.\nYan said he would pay for a flight back to Wuhan and return to Hong Kong later for the flight on the following Saturday. But he criticised Cathay’s handling of the situation.\n“I have no choice but to bear these costs myself. You cannot fight too much with these companies, it only wastes your time,” he said. “If there is a next time, I will not fly Cathay Pacific.”\n\nCathay was among the airlines that suspended all passenger and cargo flights to and from the Middle East on Saturday, following airspace closures in the wake of the regional conflict.\nAt the airport, a Cathay employee told the SCMP that passengers could change to any short or medium-haul route whose duration was roughly equal to or shorter than their original flights to Riyadh or Dubai.\nPassengers could also request refunds but would need to call the customer service hotline to process them, the employee said.\nFellow passenger Zhuang, a construction worker from Hubei who had also been travelling to Riyadh, said he would fly to Changsha on Sunday evening and take a train home to Wuhan while he waited for the situation to stabilise.\nZhuang said Cathay had offered him a refund for the cancelled flight, which had cost him more than 1,700 yuan (US$248), but noted the amount would not cover his journey to Changsha.\nUnable to fly with Cathay to Wuhan before Monday, he said he had chosen an alternative route and was “too exhausted” to stay in Hong Kong for one more night at his own expense.\n“The arrangement did not reach our expectations, but we have no choice but to accept,” Zhuang said.\nHe added that it would have been better if Cathay had offered discounts or some compensation in response to the delay.\n“They are a huge company. They should bear a portion of the responsibility,” Zhuang said.\n\nRamon Sulid was among several dozen travellers from the Philippines who had been heading to Riyadh via Hong Kong for work.\nThe 52-year-old, who has worked in construction in the Saudi capital for nearly 11 years, said he was given food and accommodation at a nearby hotel overnight after his flight was cancelled.\nHe added that airline staff had told him to come back to Cathay’s counters on Sunday morning to check the status of the flight, which had been tentatively rescheduled for Tuesday.\nSulid said he would have preferred the airline to arrange free accommodation for the entire period he had to wait, but was fine to fly back home if necessary.\n“If we had to go back to the Philippines, no problem, as it’s our country. But the worry is still there, as I cannot start work in Riyadh,” Sulid said.\nMany airlines around the globe are exempt from monetary compensation for flight cancellations or delays caused by armed conflict and security threats, which are classed as “extraordinary circumstances” or force majeure events.\nBut airlines in some regions are still required to provide care, such as meals and accommodation, and offer rebooking or refunds.\nThe SCMP has contacted Cathay for comment on its compensation policy and for a response to passengers’ complaints.\n",

            "title": "More than 40,000 Hong Kong cabbies register to accept Octopus payments",
            "description": "More than 40,000 Hong Kong taxi drivers have registered to accept Octopus payments, ahead of an electronic payment mandate that will take effect next month, with a sector representative urging authorities to exercise discretion during the initial phase of the roll-out.\nOn April 1, all cabbies will be required to offer at least two electronic payment options to passengers as part of a broader plan to enhance the quality and image of taxi services.\nHong Kong has about 46,000 active taxi drivers, according to the Transport Department, with the registration figure representing about 85 per cent of cabbies.\nAuthorities have stipulated that cabbies must offer at least one QR code option – such as AlipayHK, WeChat Pay HK or BoC Pay – alongside a non-scanning alternative, which includes Octopus, credit cards or the Faster Payment System (FPS).\nOn Sunday, Octopus said more than 40,000 drivers had registered for the Octopus App for Business or adopted the Bluetooth-enabled mobile point-of-sale (POS) system, representing a 40 per cent increase in users and a 65 per cent uptick in transaction value year on year.\nThe company said it had waived the bank account fund transfer handling fee for taxi drivers since the launch of the app in 2018, in a bid to lower the entry barriers and promote the industry’s transition to electronic payments.\nAll they need to do is open an account by providing their identity card, taxi driver identity plate and proof of a bank account.\nOnce the account is opened, they receive a complimentary mobile POS to collect electronic payments. They can choose to transfer fares to their own cards or their bank accounts through FPS.\n“Since 2018, we have been working closely with the sector to understand the needs of drivers and passengers and actively promote the wider use of electronic payments,” CEO Tim Ying said.\n“We have been offering a zero-cost payment solution for taxi drivers with currently no plans for adjustment, so they can adopt electronic payments with confidence and enjoy the convenience brought by technology.\n\nWong Tai-hoi, secretary general of the Taxi Drivers and Operators Association, agreed that e-payment options could enhance service efficiency, but urged authorities to exercise discretion in the early stage.\n“We hope that during the transition period, police enforcement will focus on advice and verbal warnings rather than issuing penalty tickets every time,” he said.\nChau Kwok-keung, chairman of the Hong Kong Taxi and Public Light Bus Association, said about 60 to 70 per cent of cabbies were ready for the new mandate.\n“Octopus is the most popular option, followed by Wonder, a platform that accepts more than 30 kinds of e-payment methods. More than 4,000 will be using the latter by April,” he said.\n“Most e-payment platforms charge no administrative fee for now, but if they do so in the future, the burden of cost will inevitably be transferred to passengers.”\nHe added that about one-third of the income of taxi drivers came from e-payments, an option that is more popular among mainland Chinese tourists.\nNearly two-thirds of Hong Kong taxi drivers are aged 60 or older, with an average age of about 58.4 to 60 years.\nChau said that as most e-payment methods only required the passengers to tap their phones or cards, the older drivers should be able to operate the systems.\n",

            "description": "The Hong Kong government is prepared for greater global market volatility and risks, higher trade costs, and fluctuating commodity prices stemming from the joint US-Israel attack on Iran, according to the city’s finance chief\nShortly after Iranian state media confirmed the death of Supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei in the air strikes, Financial Secretary Paul Chan Mo-po said on Sunday that the conflict created “significant global uncertainty” in the world economy.\n“I expect increased volatility in financial markets, with faster and less predictable capital flows. Capital may come [from different places] to Hong Kong to seek a safe haven,” he said in a televised interview.\n“The government is prepared for that and will manage financial risks with caution.”\nChan said that the conflict was likely to have a short-term impact on oil and gold prices, and may also affect international trade, transport costs, and logistics timelines.\nHong Kong did not have many direct trade and investment ties with Iran, but the government would continue to manage risks as the situation evolved, he added.\nDespite being hit by US sanctions, Iran remains one of the world’s major oil producers, exporting around 1.9 million barrels per day, according to the International Energy Agency.\nMainland China is Iran’s biggest buyer, purchasing more than 80 per cent of its exported oil.\nThe future of the Islamic Republic has plunged into uncertainty with the death of Khamenei.\nUS President Donald Trump has called for regime change, with Iran launching retaliatory strikes on bases with US troops across the Middle East.\n\nEarlier in the day, Hong Kong’s Secretary for Commerce and Economic Development Algernon Yau Ying-wah noted that geopolitical tensions and ongoing conflicts in the Middle East could present a “positive opportunity” for the city.\nHe said that amid the uncertainties, more countries were strengthening their ties with the mainland and “you see leaders from different places paying diplomatic visits to China”.\nHong Kong, as a key player in the global supply chain and a “superconnector” for firms tapping into the mainland market, could benefit from the nation’s economic development, he added.\nIn an interview with the South China Morning Post in late 2024, Iran’s ambassador to China Mohsen Bakhtiar said Iranian companies had difficulty accessing banking and financial services in Hong Kong due to US sanctions.\nHe was optimistic about the possibility of more exchanges between the two jurisdictions, saying Iran could serve as a “gateway” for Hong Kong to access markets in Central and Western Asia.\n",

            "description": "Chinese smartphone makers are set to introduce their latest handsets at MWC Barcelona, as the mobile industry navigates an ongoing memory crunch and a pivot to artificial intelligence.\nSome Android phone makers are also expected to showcase experimental robots and other AI devices at the annual trade show formerly known as Mobile World Congress, which will run from March 2 to 5.\nHonor, an independent brand formerly under Huawei Technologies, will unveil more details about its highly anticipated “robot phone”, a concept AI-enabled handset featuring a fold-out gimbal-attached camera, on the eve of MWC Barcelona.\nThe smartphone maker is also slated to reveal its first humanoid robot at its Sunday event in Barcelona, a major development since the announcement of its foray into China’s crowded robotics space last May.\nBesides the experimental robotic devices, the Shenzhen-based smartphone maker will also launch its latest foldable handset Magic V6, featuring a stronger hinge and upgraded AI functions.\nVivo, the world’s fourth-largest smartphone maker according to IDC data, is set for the global debut of its flagship X300 Ultra. With a focus on enhanced imaging and videography capabilities, the X300 Ultra represents the firm’s latest push into the international premium market.\n\nThe new models from Honor and Vivo will face off against the latest offerings from Huawei and Samsung Electronics in the global arena. Huawei launched the international version of its flagship Mate 80 Pro model on Thursday, the same day Samsung unveiled the Galaxy S26 series with a sharpened focus on AI.\nThe smartphone makers’ high-stakes innovations and experiments come as the broader industry scrambles to cope with surging memory chip costs, which threaten to squeeze profit margins and drive down shipment volumes.\nGlobal shipments of smartphones in 2026 are forecast to decline 12.9 per cent to 1.12 billion units, marking the largest drop ever for the industry due to the memory chip shortage, IDC said on Friday.\n“What we are witnessing is not a temporary squeeze, but a tsunami-like shock originating in the memory supply chain, with ripple effects spreading across the entire consumer electronics industry,” said Francisco Jeronimo, IDC vice-president for worldwide client devices.\n\n“The global smartphone market, particularly Android manufacturers, faces a significant threat,” Jeronimo said, adding that smaller and low-end players would struggle with rising costs while Apple and Samsung could use the opportunity to expand their market share.\nMeizu, a small Chinese smartphone brand, became one of the first victims of the situation after it announced on Friday it would halt research and development work on new handsets.\nThe decision came after the firm, owned by DreamSmart Group, announced in January that it pulled the plug on the launch of a new handset, the Meizu 22 Air.\n“The sharp rise in memory prices … dealt a huge shock to our commercial plan for smartphones,” Wan Zhiqiang, the firm’s chief marketing officer, said at the time.\n",

            "title": "Warm winter no match: China’s sportswear sector posts surprise growth",
            "description": "China’s major sportswear makers have shrugged off soft consumer spending and a warm winter, according to analysts.\nRetail sales in China’s sportswear sector picked up in the first two months of 2026 and beat expectations, helped by fresh policy support and Chinese New Year demand, analysts said. Separately, Chinese households also tuned into the Winter Olympics, where domestic sportswear giants Li Ning and Anta had high visibility.\n“We are turning more positive on the China sportswear industry for the first time in 12 months,” Jefferies equity analysts John Chou, Boya Zhen and Anne Ling said in a report.\nJefferies forecasts sportswear retail sales to grow by more than 5 per cent year on year in the first two months of 2026, a meaningful acceleration from a flattish fourth quarter of 2025. “Overall, we view this as a positive surprise, especially during a warm winter,” the analysts said. Down jackets make up a large share of winter sales for the sector, so warmer weather typically weighs on demand.\nChinese sportswear groups such as Li Ning and Anta have gained market share from international rivals in recent years, a shift that accelerated in 2021 after some global brands said they would stop using Xinjiang cotton over forced-labour allegations. Domestic brands including Anta, Li Ning and Peak publicly backed Xinjiang cotton and highlighted its use in their marketing.\n\nMore broadly, as the economy cooled, some consumers traded down to lower-priced domestic brands, supporting local players’ momentum, although growth has shown signs of easing since late last year amid softer spending.\nFor the fourth quarter of 2025, Anta’s major brands delivered a sequential slowdown amid sector-wise sales weakness, according to Nomura, which lowered Anta’s target price from HK$117 to HK$116.30 in January. Li Ning also reported a low single-digit fall in the fourth quarter in its gross merchandise value.\nBecause of that, management at Li Ning and Anta were very cautious in their guidance on recent quarterly operating data calls, said Charlotte Zhou, an analyst at CGS International.\n“We’re seeing a marginal improvement,” Zhou said. Many sportswear brands were also rolling out more of their spring collections, which had helped offset pressure from the warm winter.\nGovernment support for sports facilities had helped drive participation in sports such as badminton, supporting demand for Li Ning’s and Yonex’s badminton products, Jefferies said.\nDeutsche Bank said Li Ning’s growth had been supported by strong running-shoe intellectual property and an improving brand image through Winter Olympics and marathon sponsorships.\nLi Ning is an official partner of the Chinese Olympic Committee and has supplied official apparel for Chinese Olympic delegations. Anta has provided professional gear for 13 Chinese national teams during the Games, including for freestyle skier Eileen Gu.\nOnline sales across the sector surged 20 per cent year on year in January, up from 14 per cent in December and 4 per cent in October and November combined, according to Deutsche Bank. Within the sector, Anta’s core brand posted 20 per cent annual growth, while Li Ning’s sales rose a stronger 24 per cent.\nBut on whether the momentum could be sustained going forward, Zhou said: “We will need to watch a bit longer.”\nRichard Lin, chief consumer analyst at investment bank SPDB International, said that may not be necessary. Chinese consumers tended to spend more during holidays and shopping festivals where stores give big discounts, but less at other times, Lin said. “What we are seeing is peak seasons are getting stronger, and off-seasons are getting weak.”\n",

            "description": "The top executive of Wuliangye Yibin – China’s second-largest liquor producer – has come under investigation for suspected corruption.\nZeng Congqin, 57, chairman and party secretary of the state-owned liquor giant, is suspected of serious violations of party discipline and law – a typical reference to corruption – the provincial anti-corruption body, Sichuan Discipline Inspection Commission, announced on Saturday night.\nZeng is being investigated by authorities in Yibin, a major city in the southwestern province where the group is based.\nThe Shenzhen-listed liquor maker said in an exchange filing on Saturday that Zeng was being held and that the firm had received notices from authorities. The company said the matter would not have a major impact on its normal operations.\nZeng’s name has been removed from the leadership list on the Wuliangye Group website. His last appearance was at a group-level meeting on February 24, where he gave a speech and emphasised principles including safe production, anti-corruption integrity and risk prevention.\n\nA native of Yibin, Zeng started his career working in various posts in local counties and townships before rising to district party secretary in the city and joining Wuliangye Yibin in 2019 as deputy party secretary.\nIn 2022, Zeng became party secretary, replacing Li Shuguang, who was put under anti-corruption investigation in January 2025. Li, placed under judicial procedure nine months later, will be prosecuted and tried.\nZeng is the latest high-profile official brought down by China’s anti-corruption campaign, part of which has targeted the liquor sector.\nIn January 2025, Kweichow Moutai’s chairman Ding Xiongjun was placed under investigation, following two former chairmen of the company, Yuan Renguo and Gao Weidong, in 2019 and 2022. Both later received life sentences.\nIn 2025, Beijing imposed a ban on excessive banquets, at which liquor is often consumed. The ban had a serious impact on liquor makers like Kweichow Moutai and Wuliangye Yibin, both of which reported the lowest growth in revenue and profit in a decade.\nFor the third quarter of 2025, Wuliangye Yibin’s revenue fell 53 per cent to 8.2 billion yuan (US$1.2 billion) and its net profit attributable to shareholders fell 66 per cent to 2 billion yuan.\nThe ban has worried many institutional investors. In a survey last July by Goldman Sachs, mutual funds, private equity funds and asset managers said they were worried that it could hamper Beijing’s effort to boost consumption and the broader economy.\nAlso on Saturday night, China’s top anti-corruption body, the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection, announced that Han Song, vice-general manager of state conglomerate China Resources (Holdings), was suspected of serious violations of discipline and the law. He had voluntarily surrendered and was currently under investigation.\n",

            "description": "A joint US-Israeli attack on Iran forced airlines to cancel or delay at least 27 flights from Hong Kong to destinations in the Middle East on Sunday, leaving travellers stranded at the city’s airport.\nHundreds of passengers packed Hong Kong International Airport on Sunday morning to inquire about the suspended departures, primarily to Riyadh in Saudi Arabia, Doha in Qatar and Dubai in the United Arab Emirates (UAE).\nHong Kong flag carrier Cathay Pacific Airways was among the airlines to suspend all passenger and cargo flights to and from the Middle East on Saturday, following airspace closures in the wake of the air strikes.\nLuo Kui, a 45-year-old Shanghai software architect, was stranded overnight in Hong Kong after his Cathay flight to Dubai, scheduled at 5pm on Saturday, was cancelled.\nOn Sunday morning, the airline gave him two options: he could either keep his connecting flight to Dubai – tentatively rescheduled for March 4 – but pay for his own accommodation until departure, or change his ticket and return to Shanghai.\n“This isn’t fair,” Luo, who has worked in Abu Dhabi for two years, told the South China Morning Post. “A flight from Shanghai to Hong Kong takes only a few hours – about a third of the time it takes to fly from Hong Kong to Dubai. In a fair situation, the airline should refund some money to us.”\nHe added that he had chosen to return to Shanghai on Sunday afternoon.\n“Who knows how long I would have to stay in Hong Kong until the war ends,” Luo said. “Why not go home first and see when the situation stabilises … I will at least have more control over my losses.”\nAs overnight retaliatory attacks by Iran spread across the Gulf states, four people were injured at a concourse in Dubai International Airport, where there was “minor damage”, according to the UAE’s media office.\nA check on the Hong Kong airport website on Sunday by the SCMP found that flights to Dubai were the most affected: three passenger flights and nine cargo flights were cancelled, and three cargo flights were delayed.\nThe air strikes also led to the cancellation of one passenger flight and three cargo flights, and the delay of five cargo flights, to Doha. The website showed that a cargo flight to Abu Dhabi and two flights to Riyadh were also cancelled on Sunday.\nThe Airport Authority told the SCMP that as of 11am on Sunday, nine passenger flights had been cancelled due to the situation in Iran. It advised affected passengers to contact the relevant airlines to make alternative arrangements.\nHong Kong’s Travel Industry Council said that Dubai and Doha were major hubs for connecting flights to and from Europe, so a temporary airspace shutdown in the Middle East would greatly disrupt those routes.\nDespite the situation, fewer than 10 tours scheduled to depart or arrive in Hong Kong on Sunday and Monday would be affected, the council added.\n\nSteve Huen Kwok-chuen, executive director of EGL Tours, said a group of 21 people were stranded in Morocco after their flight to Hong Kong was cancelled on Saturday night. Arrangements were made for them to stay in a hotel until flights could resume.\nPlans were also disrupted for another group of 26 travellers scheduled to leave Hong Kong for Morocco.\nHuen said that a tour group in Dubai was unable to return to Hong Kong and was awaiting further information on Saturday night.\n“The situation is not very clear, we are still observing [developments],” he said.\nAirlines across the globe have been forced to cancel flights or circumvent parts of the Middle East due to ongoing security concerns.\nAs of Sunday midnight, live data from aviation analytics firm Cirium showed that 865 out of 3,326 flights operated by 12 airlines and scheduled for Middle Eastern destinations have been cancelled, as airspace was closed over the UAE and Qatar.\nQatar as a destination country recorded the highest cancellation rate of 50.8 per cent, followed by Israel and the UAE at 48.6 per cent and 35 per cent, respectively.\n",

            "title": "Hong Kong-listed Chinese drug firms set to turn corner on rising sales, deals",
            "description": "Hong Kong-listed mainland Chinese pharmaceutical companies are on track to deliver full-year profits, as surging drug sales and lucrative out-licensing deals with global partners start to pay off after years of research and development outlay.\n“Despite domestic challenges, particularly drug pricing pressure, the earnings performance of innovative drugs should still fare well in China in 2025,” said Tony Ren, head of Asia Healthcare Research at Macquarie Capital.\nInnovent Biologics, the first Chinese company cleared to sell a drug for weight loss and diabetes, is expected to post its first full-year profit since going public – 984 million yuan (US$143.5 million) in 2025 – compared with a loss of 94.63 million yuan in 2024, according to estimates compiled by Bloomberg.\nRevenue at Innovent, best known for its cancer treatment drug development, jumped about 45 per cent in 2025 to roughly 11.9 billion yuan, marking a “historic milestone”, the company said in a filing on February 4. The company, which launched six new products last year, releases its earnings release in late March.\n\nFounded in 2011, Innovent was one of the first batch of firms to go public in 2018 under a new Hong Kong listing rule that let pre-revenue and loss-making drug and medical device developers raise capital.\nIts diabetes and obesity drug mazdutide could bring in about 2.4 billion yuan this year, along with nearly 2.7 billion yuan in collaboration revenue from deals with Takeda and Eli Lilly, said Zhang Jialin, Nomura’s head of China healthcare research, in a note.\nBeOne, formerly known as BeiGene and rebranded in 2024 amid US-China geopolitical tensions, posted its first full-year profit since it was founded in 2010. The oncology drug developer reported a net profit of US$286.93 million, compared with a net loss of US$644.79 million a year earlier, according to an exchange filing on Thursday.\nThe profit was due to the runaway global success of its blood cancer drug Brukinsa, which raked in US$3.9 billion in sales, including US$2.8 billion in the US alone, eclipsing AstraZeneca’s Calquence, which generated US$3.5 billion, according to a Macquarie Capital report on Friday.\nBoth Innovent and BeOne were among the top performers in turning novel drug candidates into real-world treatments and commercial products, according to a new index gauging China’s pharmaceutical innovation compiled by US consultancy SAI MedPartners and its unit Idea Pharma in December.\nOther notable names on the list include Jiangsu Hengrui Pharmaceuticals and Hansoh Pharma.\nNomura’s Zhang expects Hengrui, China’s largest listed drug maker by market value, to report a 32 per cent jump in fourth-quarter net profit to 2.3 billion yuan. For full-year 2026, he predicted a 30 per cent jump in net profit to 11.2 billion yuan, nearly 13 per cent above Bloomberg estimates.\nThe growth was expected to be driven by newly launched drugs and license fees from a partnership with British multinational GSK for an experimental pill for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, a long-term lung illness that makes it difficult to breathe, Zhang said.\nHengrui launched seven new drugs in China last year, including trastuzumab rezetecan, the first antibody-drug conjugate developed on the mainland and approved in the country for lung cancer patients, and SHR2554, an oral pill for blood cancer patients.\nNomura forecast Hansoh’s revenues would grow 27 per cent year on year to about 7.3 billion yuan in the second half of 2025, slightly above Bloomberg estimates.\nThe wave of profits comes as several Chinese drug makers out-license their early-stage drugs to global pharmaceutical behemoths in search of new growth engines ahead of looming patent expiries on old blockbusters, with the deal flow showing no sign of cooling.\nOn Tuesday, Hangzhou Sciwind Biosciences granted Pfizer exclusive rights to sell its new GLP‑1 injection ecnoglutide in mainland China, in return for up to US$495 million in upfront, regulatory and sales milestone payments.\n“Partnering with Chinese biopharma is no longer opportunistic and is now an integral part of the global … research and development strategy,” said Macquarie’s Ren.\n“Investors appear to be showing a keen interest in China healthcare and view it as a must-own sector. Some hedge funds are deploying capital from Japan to China.”\n",

            "description": "At least five Hong Kong universities have backed the government’s proposal to launch study tours aimed at attracting non-local secondary students to pursue higher education in the city, with programmes featuring topics such as AI.\nThe University of Hong Kong (HKU), the city’s oldest tertiary institution, said it would offer up to 35 programmes this summer, giving outstanding non-local students a chance to earn full scholarships.\nIn this year’s government budget, education authorities said they hoped tertiary institutions would organise more short-term study tours, especially during summer breaks when campus resources are underused, to encourage non-local students to pursue studies in the city.\nA source said universities had already been running study tours, but the government now wanted them upgraded to a “high level” to attract more students from outside the city and encourage them to remain in Hong Kong for higher education.\nThe source said the tours could focus on themes ranging from technology and innovation to arts, culture and creativity.\nIn the United States and the United Kingdom, some universities have offered similar summer programmes for high school students as pathways to full undergraduate degrees, although admission is not guaranteed.\nThe HKU Academy for the Talented will offer up to 35 short-term pre-university programmes for non-local students from June to August, according to a spokesman. The courses will cover fields such as artificial intelligence, science, arts and humanities, medicine and healthcare, law and the social sciences.\n“Secondary school students from around the world will be able to experience authentic Hong Kong university life. Outstanding international students will also have the chance to receive full scholarships to participate,” it said.\n\nHKU has been offering such summer programmes since 2011, with nearly half of past participants coming from mainland China, South Korea, India, Australia, the US and the UK.\nA spokesman for the Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK) said the summer institute had run a two-week academic enrichment programme for local and non-local high school students for nearly two decades.\n“[CUHK] will continue to do so in 2026. The institute offers an immersive opportunity for students from Hong Kong and overseas to experience university-level studies and campus life at CUHK,” it said.\nLast year, the programme welcomed more than 340 students from Hong Kong and 16 countries and regions across Asia, Europe and North America.\nThe Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST) said it launched a preparatory programme this year for both local and non-local high school students.\n“This initiative offers both year-round online and in-person activities, allowing students to explore academic options, connect with faculty mentors and experience our vibrant learning environment,” it said.\nLast year, HKUST held its first large-scale Summer Boostcamp for Polymaths, a nine-day programme that attracted more than 150 high school students from over 17 countries, including South Korea, Indonesia, the Philippines, Turkey, Kazakhstan, Russia, the Netherlands, the US, Canada and Australia.\nIt said participants gained a holistic experience that combined academic exploration, exposure to innovation and cultural activities.\n“A highlight was the capstone project, which challenged students to devise innovative solutions to real-world problems set by our partner companies,” it added.\nA spokesman for Polytechnic University said its summer institute has welcomed high school students from around the world since 2023 to experience the institution’s teaching and learning culture, along with a variety of local tours and cultural activities.\nThis year, its 12-day programme allowed local and non-local students to experience residential hall life, attend mini-lectures on AI and data analytics, innovation and entrepreneurship, and take part in a company visit.\nA spokesman for Lingnan University said its Office of Global Education was running a summer school to attract non-local students and school leavers, aiming to provide participants with an opportunity to experience campus life and facilities.\nStudents would join various excursions to explore the cultural offerings of Hong Kong.\n",

            "title": "The big cornerstone comeback: what’s driving investors back to Hong Kong IPOs?",
            "description": "Until last year, Fidelity International’s most significant cornerstone commitments on the Hong Kong initial public offering (IPO) market dated back to 2021, when Chinese short-video platform Kuaishou Technology raised US$5.4 billion and healthcare firm Medlive Technology completed a US$543.4 million listing.\nThen for the next four years, the asset manager went quiet.\nLate last year it returned to Chinese assets in force. It backed gold miner Zijin Gold International’s US$3.2 billion listing in September 2025, followed by crypto platform HashKey Group, snack retailer Busy Ming and pork giant Muyuan Foods.\nFidelity’s comeback is not an isolated case.\nHeavyweight global investors such as BlackRock, Temasek and Qatar Investment Authority are reappearing in cornerstone books, signalling a shift in sentiment – and raising the question of what has changed in Hong Kong’s favour.\n“We have seen a robust comeback of international long-only investors – especially European and Middle Eastern sovereign funds – in Hong Kong’s IPO market, and we expect that momentum to carry into 2026,” said John Lee, vice-chairman and head of Greater China for global banking at UBS.\nThe return is not limited to Europe and the Middle East, with US and Singapore-based funds also re-emerging as cornerstone backers in major listings, particularly across consumption, industrial and hi-tech sectors.\n“In 2023 and 2024, many international investors reduced China exposure altogether,” Lee said. “But the tone has definitely changed over the past 12 to 18 months, with a gradual return of investors adding back China weightings – a trend that became more pronounced by the middle of 2025.”\nThe shift has been supported by improving sentiment towards consumption, clearer policy direction in technology and industrial upgrading, and growing confidence in the global competitiveness of Chinese companies, particularly in artificial intelligence and advanced manufacturing, he added.\nHong Kong’s equity market delivered its strongest annual gains since 2017 last year, supported by improved liquidity and renewed risk appetite. Benchmarks outpaced several major developed-market indices, while valuations remained well below those of US peers.\nFor investors such as Fidelity International, the move reflects a strong recalibration of risk appetite.\n“The Hong Kong IPO market today feels more anchored by companies listing for longer-term strategic reasons rather than short-term fundraising considerations,” said Tina Tian, portfolio manager at Fidelity International.\nFrom a risk-reward perspective, it felt like the right time to re-engage with Hong Kong, she added, noting that from both an issuer and investor perspective the quality and structure of the IPO pipeline had improved materially.\n“As global regulatory and geopolitical dynamics evolved, a Hong Kong IPO or secondary listing is increasingly seen as a way to broaden the investor base, enhance liquidity and maintain access to international capital within a familiar regulatory framework,” Tian said.\nThe cornerstone investor has long been a steady feature of Hong Kong’s IPO market, offering much-needed ballast to a market prone to sharp swings.\nWith early commitments to buy sizeable stakes and lock-up periods after listing, cornerstone funds anchor pricing, signal confidence and help stabilise deals before trading begins.\nForeign capital accounted for about 27 per cent of all 353 cornerstone investors across the top 20 IPOs of 2025 and those priced up to February 3, this year, according to data compiled by the SCMP.\nTheir presence has grown not only in headcount but also in investment size, with commitments noticeably larger than in 2022.\n“Large scale US funds are leaning into China’s consumption, infrastructure and industrial sectors,” a shift away from their earlier preference for property developers, said George Wu, partner at global law firm DLA Piper.\nThe contrast in cornerstone investor profiles between recent and older deals is stark.\nWhen China Tourism Group Duty Free raised US$2.3 billion in August 2022, the year’s largest IPO in Hong Kong, its cornerstone line-up was dominated by state-backed funds, including China State-owned Enterprise Mixed Ownership Reform Fund and China Structural Reform Fund.\nFast forward to last year, and the names tell a different story.\nMainland Chinese soft drink maker Eastroc Beverage, which raised US$1.3 billion in the city’s largest IPO as of February 3, drew 16 cornerstone investors, including six global heavyweights such as sovereign wealth fund Qatar Investment Authority – the single largest cornerstone investor with US$150 million – alongside Temasek, BlackRock, Fidelity and JPMorgan Asset Management.\nBlackRock put US$35 million into snack retailer Busy Ming. In industrials, Oaktree and Jane Street joined BlackRock in backing machinery maker Sany Heavy Industry, while Jane Street also took a cornerstone stake in air-conditioning components supplier Zhejiang Sanhua Intelligent Controls.\nMiddle Eastern sovereign wealth funds have been among the most active backers of China’s cutting-edge technology listings.\nAbu Dhabi Investment Authority was the largest cornerstone investor in AI start-up MiniMax with a US$65 million commitment and also led the cornerstone line-up in Shenzhen Edge Medical with US$15 million.\nKuwait Investment Authority ranked among the biggest cornerstone investors in battery giant Contemporary Amperex Technology, pledging US$500 million.\n“The direction of private capital flows is driven mainly by financial returns,” Wu said. “But in certain sensitive tech areas, geopolitical and national security concerns inevitably discourage some investors from taking action.”\n\n\n\n\nM&amp;G Investments, the London-based asset manager, was involved last year in the listings of logistics firm Jingdong Industrials and bubble tea chain Mixue Group as a cornerstone investor.\n“Our intention is to be long-term shareholders from the outset,” said Vikas Pershad, portfolio manager for Asian equities at M&amp;G Investments.\n“We see compelling opportunities in several areas: the renewables supply chain, scaled franchise-driven business models expanding domestically and internationally, technology platforms and logistics companies.\n“The common characteristics across these sectors are wide competitive moats, improving unit economics, robust balance sheets, long growth runways and valuations that remain discounted relative to global peers.”\nThe share of IPO proceeds locked up by cornerstone investors also climbed between 2021 and 2026, with the portion of total funds rising to roughly 49 per cent from about 14 per cent, according to LSEG Data &amp; Analytics data.\nMore than 270 global institutions acted as cornerstone investors in Hong Kong IPOs last year, while 40 listings included at least one international cornerstone backer, Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing (HKEX) data showed.\nSo far in 2026, cornerstone tranches have accounted for around half of the US$1.81 billion raised across 11 Hong Kong IPOs.\nFor many global long-only investors, the renewed participation as cornerstone investors marks a clear break from the years when exposure to Chinese equities – and Hong Kong IPOs in particular – was sharply reduced or frozen altogether.\n“That said, state-linked capital helped companies bridge a difficult funding period and reach the IPO stage,” Wu said. “At the same time, local governments were advancing industrial upgrading amid property downturn and sluggish consumption, and companies urgently needed capital between 2022 and 2024. It was a very reasonable match.”\n“The direction of Chinese government capital flows is about supporting local industries, promoting employment and creating local social and economic value,” he added.\nGovernment-backed entities made up about 18 per cent of all cornerstone investors across the largest IPOs of 2025 and those priced up to February 3, this year.\nWhile Chinese government-linked investment vehicles have scaled back their overall share of cornerstone allocations during 2022 and 2024, they continue to anchor the country’s strategic sectors such as artificial intelligence, semiconductors, electric vehicles and new energy.\nAnalysts said their holdings underscored China’s push to shift away from property-driven growth towards new economic engines.\nSeveral semiconductor and biotech deals this year saw meaningful government participation. For instance, cornerstone investors in OmniVision Integrated Circuits, GigaDevice Semiconductor and Shanghai Iluvatar CoreX Semiconductor all included state-linked funds.\nWhile state backing has supported demand in strategic sectors, the broader revival in cornerstone activity has been driven by the return of international investors alongside reforms introduced by Hong Kong’s bourse operator.\nHKEX, which runs Asia’s third-largest stock market with a capitalisation of about US$6.5 trillion, has in recent years introduced a series of listing changes aimed at widening the pipeline of issuers and expanding the base of institutional investors.\n\n\nIts IPO allocation overhaul, effective August 4, guaranteed institutional investors at least 40 per cent of new shares through the bookbuilding tranche while cutting the potential clawback to the retail subscription pool to 35 per cent from 50 per cent under the old rules, a move aimed at reducing volatility in debut trading.\nThe growing prevalence of so-called A+H listings and “return-to-Hong Kong” transactions has also meant that investors are increasingly engaging with companies that are already well researched and subject to regulatory oversight in other major markets, helping to rebuild confidence in deal quality.\nThat shift has been reinforced by changes to the listing regime. Since 2018, HKEX has introduced Chapter 18A and, more recently, Chapter 18C to accommodate pre-revenue biotech and specialist technology companies, widening the pipeline of issuers and drawing fresh pools of capital.\nJohnson Chui, managing director and head of global issuer services at HKEX, said the increasingly diverse mix of participants in IPOs reflected investor confidence in Hong Kong as a resilient and internationally competitive capital-raising venue.\n“HKEX will continue to enhance its attractiveness to global investors,” he said.\nAccording to Peihao Huang, head of equity capital markets for Asia Pacific at J.P. Morgan, cornerstone investors were essential to issuers and banks in setting valuation parameters, identifying opinion-leading institutions and reducing execution risk and helping build momentum during book-building.\nShe added that the presence of well-known international cornerstone investors often strengthened demand from other institutional and retail investors, as their participation was widely viewed as a validation of deal quality and valuation discipline.\n“Cornerstone participation has always been a defining feature of Hong Kong IPOs, but in this cycle it has become the new norm,” she said.\n",

            "title": "Are new Hong Kong subdivided flat standards triggering a wave of evictions?",
            "description": "Hongkonger Chan Sai-chiu considers the 60 sq ft subdivided flat he rents to be home, going out of his way to make the cramped space in Sham Shui Po’s ageing Yee Wa Building more liveable by repainting the walls and setting up his own kitchen.\nThe 72-year-old considers the flat’s HK$3,000 (US$383) rent to be a perfect fit for his tight budget, as he lives off about HK$5,000 from social security payments and receives a rental subsidy of HK$2,500.\nThe building also suits the retiree, who is chronically ill and struggles to walk, because it has lifts and is only 500 metres (1,640 feet) away from a local wet market.\nBut Chan was caught by surprise last December, just in the middle of his two-year contract, when landlords for the building gave more than 200 households three months to move out.\nThe decision was prompted by renovation plans to ensure the properties complied with the Basic Housing Units Ordinance, which takes effect on Sunday.\nThe new law stipulates that only “basic housing units”, referring to certified subdivided homes that meet the new minimum standards, can be leased on the market.\nBut authorities are allowing landlords to lease substandard properties while getting four years to make rectifications.\n“The owners have exploited our rights. I have to stand up for myself,” Chan said.\n“Under the new law, unless the government has accommodation arrangements for tenants, there will be evictions forever.”\nThe Yee Wa Building case is just the tip of the iceberg since lawmakers voted to approve the new regulatory regime last September.\n\n\nAs the Basic Housing Units Ordinance takes effect, advocates and professionals have called for ensuring a stable supply of temporary accommodation for subdivided housing tenants likely to be uprooted, along with a comprehensive enforcement plan to plug loopholes.\nThere are currently about 220,000 residents living in subdivided homes.\nAn earlier government survey also estimates that around 33,000 subdivided flats – 30 per cent of the city’s total – would require significant fixes before they could be deemed basic housing units.\nIn the case of Yee Wa Building residents, authorities stepped in a month after the eviction was announced. But the issue has yet to be fully resolved.\nThe Housing Bureau deployed an NGO to offer help after Chan and tenants made headlines in January.\nWhile the owners claimed to have earlier offered a three-to-12-month grace period to tenants, the bureau said the landlords were still exploring the arrangement and that the NGO would assist residents in moving to temporary housing or seeking other private properties.\nAccording to the bureau, as of late February, among the 138 households it had contacted, 43 had applied for transitional flats, 10 had moved to light public housing, and 39 had their applications approved to stay at a hostel offering single-person rooms just a five-minute walk from their old homes.\nAngela Lui Yi-shan, a community organiser at the Society for Community Organisation, noted that some building residents had already been evicted before such incidents had come to light.\nSuch residents had moved to other substandard homes in the district, meaning that they would be uprooted again when the operators decided to fix the flats to meet legal requirements.\nLui said low-income individuals and two-person households, such as the elderly and single-parent families, would be hit hardest under the new regulatory regime.\n\nLui said such residents could only rent small, substandard properties with rents of about HK$3,000 and could not afford a basic housing unit, which must be at least 86 sq ft, have a proper window and come with an individual toilet, among other requirements.\nShe noted that rents for subdivided flats of a better quality were naturally higher, and their leases could increase by 5 to 15 per cent following renovations.\n“Those with the lowest purchasing power and or the most underprivileged may have to resort to renting a substandard flat on the black market or resort to bed-space flats,” she said.\n“The law aims to improve living quality … but we need to observe whether the living quality has been downgraded in some cases.”\nTenants affected by the new law can apply for temporary housing, subject to availability.\nResidents who have waited for a public rental home for at least three years can apply for the light public housing homes built by the government, while others can apply for flats under the transitional housing scheme introduced in 2018.\nSecretary for Housing Winnie Ho Wing-yin earlier said around 4,000 transitional flats were reserved for affected subdivided flat tenants, and was exploring increasing the supply of such homes in urban areas.\nAs of December, around 16,690 transitional flats are in operation, and another 2,700 are set to be built by 2027.\nLui said that the government could only eradicate substandard housing and regulate the subdivided housing market effectively with sufficient housing supply and strong enforcement, as tenants tended to stay quiet rather than risk losing their homes.\n“Tenants tend not to report substandard properties as they can lose their homes, especially when they may not find a resettlement suitable to their needs. It is not ideal if the report burden lies on tenants,” she said.\n\n\n\n\nRobin Leung Chi-tim, the immediate past president of the Hong Kong Institute of Surveyors, echoed the need for a comprehensive enforcement plan, as authorities would only start taking action from March 2027.\nHe said authorities would have a list of operators registered for the three-year grace period, but they would be kept in the dark about landlords who did not apply and were leasing their properties illegally.\nLeung also observed another possible loophole after the grace period, as the new law only regulated two or more subdivided housing tenancies in a flat.\nA homeowner could claim that they only leased one subdivided home and were living in the rest of the space, but were actually letting out their properties to several tenants, he said.\n“It can be difficult to prove. Officers have to go undercover. Authorities have to devise effective enforcement actions,” he said.\nWhile many of his neighbours have since moved out, Chan said he found relocating to transitional housing in the New Territories inconvenient and expressed reluctance to share a kitchen with other tenants in a nearby hostel.\nHe has queued for public rental housing for three years and is eligible for a light public home, but he does not know when he will be allocated a temporary flat.\n“It can take eight or 10 months. I have nowhere to go,” Chan said.\n",

            "title": "Hong Kong’s small landlords turn to co-working, student hostels to survive",
            "description": "Hong Kong’s struggling office landlords are ramping up efforts to convert their assets into co-working spaces and student accommodation in a bid to adapt to intense competition and the flight to quality, according to analysts.\nWith some 3.5 million sq ft of new premium office space expected to be completed this year and next, on top of the 4.5 million sq ft added in 2024 and 2025, tenants are increasingly choosing to relocate to new and modern offices, leading to diverging fortunes for big established landlords and non-premium asset owners.\n“The persistent ‘flight to quality’ creates a profound and escalating challenge for owners of older, non-prime office buildings,” said Jack Tong, director for research and consultancy at Savills Hong Kong.\n“As corporates from high-value sectors consolidate into modern, ESG [environmental, social and governance]-compliant buildings, the demand for secondary space contracts to smaller local businesses, back-office functions and start-ups – all of which are highly price sensitive and have more options.”\nThis situation is forcing landlords to offer significant rent concessions to keep tenants.\n“For [many] landlords, asset obsolescence is no longer a distant risk but an immediate threat to cash flow and asset viability,” Tong said.\nGiven the situation, proactive landlords are exploring strategies such as repositioning their assets and converting underutilised office floors into co-working spaces and student accommodation.\n“We have seen a recent rebound in co-working space requirements, with total co-working leased floor space amounting to 1.7 million sq ft in 2025, 50 per cent higher than in 2017 when the market was consolidating,” Tong said.\nLandlords were becoming more active in the segment, setting up their co-working operations in their own premises to provide a full leasing ecosystem, according to Tong.\n\nFor example, in 2024, CK Asset Holdings, one of Hong Kong’s largest landlords and developers, launched CK Office Suites to manage a co-working office space on the 45th floor of Cheung Kong Center in Central.\nThe conversion to student housing was also gathering pace because of a huge supply-and-demand imbalance in the sector, according to Savills, which estimated an 88,000-student-bed deficit in Hong Kong currently.\n“The latest Hostel in the City Scheme reveals 25 applications were received under the scheme, involving an addition of 5,100 beds, of which 23 were commercial conversions and two new builds,” Tong said.\nRecently, the owners of Rich China Center, a grade B building in Kwun Tong, applied to the Town Planning Board to convert the asset into a student hostel, providing 117 rooms with a total of 225 beds. The South China Morning Post has reached out to the owners of Rich China Center for comment.\nMeanwhile, the city’s office property market was showing signs of stability, with net absorption of 2.1 million sq ft in 2025, the most since 2018, according to CBRE. Net absorption refers to the total amount of space taken up minus the space left vacant by tenants.\nCentral recorded the biggest improvement with a net absorption of 234,800 sq ft in the fourth quarter, the highest for the city’s main business hub since the second quarter of 2015. Net absorption for the full year stood at 496,000 sq ft, the best annual gain since 2007, CBRE said.\nDespite the pickup in leasing, overall office rents in the city fell 2.9 per cent year on year, the least since 2019, the property consultancy added.\n\n\nDemand mainly came from financial companies, accounting for 69 per cent and 62 per cent of total take-up in the last two quarters of 2025, according to Knight Frank.\nAs a result, premium offices in Central are expected to outperform the broader market this year, with rents likely to rise by as much as 8 per cent, while rents on Hong Kong Island could fall by as much as 5 per cent, Knight Frank added.\nBesides repurposing, small landlords can also survive the tough leasing environment by “enhancing competitiveness through selective and cost-effective upgrades rather than full-scale redevelopment”, said Keith Chan, economist for research and consultancy for Greater China at Knight Frank.\n“Improvements to lobbies, lift systems, building services and ESG-related features can materially uplift tenant perception,” he said.\n“Such repositioning may help capture niche demand from occupiers such as family offices, boutique financial firms and professional services, whose preferences are shifting towards higher-quality, well-managed and more efficient office environments.”\n",

            "title": "Breakthrough or hype? How WeRide aims to edge rivals in crowded robotaxi fieldWeRide says its world model has slashed costs to support global expansion, but investors question if it can deliver a last",
            "description": "WeRide, one of China’s big three robotaxi companies, has cut research and development (R&amp;D) costs by “millions” of US dollars by using artificial intelligence to train its fleet in virtual worlds, its CEO said.\nWhile rivals had also developed AI models simulating the physical world, WeRide’s efforts stood out as it was using its world model Genesis to support its global expansion strategy, said Tony Han.\n“It’s the first real marriage between physical AI and generative AI,” Han told the South China Morning Post.\nA major challenge for the autonomous vehicle industry has been the high costs associated with developing self-driving algorithms that can generalise across different markets and terrains.\nIn particular, the low tolerance for accidents has meant algorithms must be trained on many low-probability “edge cases” that occur in the real world, as shown by a recent incident in the US where a Waymo robotaxi drove passengers into a police stand-off.\n\nThis has pushed many of the industry’s leading players, including Waymo and Tesla, to turn to AI world models as they seek to reduce unit costs to drive fleet expansion.\nIn China, Guangzhou-based WeRide and crosstown rival Pony.ai have both emphasised their world model efforts in recent months, as they look to keep up with Baidu’s Apollo Go, the domestic leader by fleet size.\nHan said Genesis had allowed WeRide to test new self-driving algorithms in a matter of days in a virtual world, where previously the same tests would have required hundreds of cars operating in the real world for months.\nCrucially, Genesis enables WeRide engineers to simulate rare edge cases that are key to ensuring self-driving safety yet difficult to capture in the real world.\nThis had resulted in a reduction of at least 75 per cent in WeRide’s data labelling and collection costs, Han said, adding that such costs made up a large percentage of the company’s R&amp;D spending – around 316 million yuan (US$46 million) in the third quarter of 2025, or around 73 per cent of total operating expenses.\nHan said Genesis was almost entirely the result of advancements in generative AI technology in recent years. The company’s early experiments with physical world simulations had been rudimentary, with cars and pedestrians represented by Roblox-like blocks, limiting practical usefulness.\nThis changed as generative AI, which uses machine learning to create models of its underlying datasets, made virtual worlds increasingly accurate depictions of the real world.\n\nWeRide trained Genesis using billions of kilometres of real-world driving data collected by the company, including more than eight years of real-world edge cases. Its powerful capabilities mean WeRide could sell the model as a stand-alone product in future – a long-standing “dream” for Han, a former chief scientist of autonomous driving at Baidu.\nHan said limits on access to computational power, more than rising graphics processing unit (GPU) prices, were now the main obstacle to continued improvement, given the clear upside of investment in this area for WeRide’s bottom line.\n“Every dollar we spend improving Genesis leads to 10 times more R&amp;D efficiency, because it’s less spent on road testing and recruiting data labourers,” he said, adding they were now “probably” doubling their GPU stock every quarter. “The constraint is the shortage of memory and availability of certain advanced GPUs.”\nWith the help of AI, WeRide aims to ramp up its global fleet from around 1,000 today to up to 3,000 robotaxis by the end of this year.\nHowever, investors have shown concern for WeRide’s future in a crowded field. Apollo Go and Pony.ai aside, Chinese start-ups such as AutoX and Momenta have also recently expanded pilot programmes, while Volkswagen announced this week its plans to launch its first robotaxi fleet in the US.\nSince its November listing, WeRide’s Hong Kong shares have fallen more than 20 per cent, while its Nasdaq shares have slumped almost 70 per cent in the past year. Analysts have highlighted the company’s continued R&amp;D-driven losses as a point of concern, with profitability not expected until 2030.\n\nIt remains uncertain whether Genesis will give WeRide an edge over rivals, with Pony.ai recently touting that its world model PonyWorld generates 10 billion kilometres for testing each week.\nLeading US player Waymo also unveiled its world model earlier this month, built on Google DeepMind’s most powerful world model Genie 3. It said the collaboration with its fellow Alphabet subsidiary gave its model an edge over others in the autonomous vehicle industry, as Genie 3 was trained on a huge number of videos and not just real-world driving data.\nBeyond technical indicators, Han pointed to WeRide’s aggressive global expansion strategy as a differentiator from its competitors, as the strategy could be further enhanced with a powerful world model even if it was not industry-leading.\nWhile WeRide still lags far behind Baidu’s Apollo Go in domestic deployment, the company has already expanded to more than 40 cities across 11 countries and regions, one of the highest in the world, compared with eight for Pony.ai and three for Waymo.\nThe company struck a deal last year with Grab, the largest ride-hailing app in Southeast Asia, and announced a major expansion of its partnership with Uber earlier this month to deploy at least 1,200 robotaxis across the Middle East as soon as 2027.\nMeanwhile, Baidu said on Thursday that Apollo Go had reached 26 cities globally.\n“Genesis for us makes sense from a business expansion perspective,” said Han. “It allows us to more easily get into a new country or market without having to do all the hard work of collecting new road data.”\nWith earnings coming up on March 23, investors could expect to see a Genesis-powered boost to the company’s financial health, he said. “I think we will have very good numbers.”\n",

            "description": "WeRide, one of China’s big three robotaxi companies, has cut research and development (R&amp;D) costs by “millions” of US dollars by using artificial intelligence to train its fleet in virtual worlds, its CEO said.\nWhile rivals had also developed AI models simulating the physical world, WeRide’s efforts stood out as it was using its world model Genesis to support its global expansion strategy, said Tony Han.\n“It’s the first real marriage between physical AI and generative AI,” Han told the South China Morning Post.\nA major challenge for the autonomous vehicle industry has been the high costs associated with developing self-driving algorithms that can generalise across different markets and terrains.\nIn particular, the low tolerance for accidents has meant algorithms must be trained on many low-probability “edge cases” that occur in the real world, as shown by a recent incident in the US where a Waymo robotaxi drove passengers into a police stand-off.\n\nThis has pushed many of the industry’s leading players, including Waymo and Tesla, to turn to AI world models as they seek to reduce unit costs to drive fleet expansion.\nIn China, Guangzhou-based WeRide and crosstown rival Pony.ai have both emphasised their world model efforts in recent months, as they look to keep up with Baidu’s Apollo Go, the domestic leader by fleet size.\nHan said Genesis had allowed WeRide to test new self-driving algorithms in a matter of days in a virtual world, where previously the same tests would have required hundreds of cars operating in the real world for months.\nCrucially, Genesis enables WeRide engineers to simulate rare edge cases that are key to ensuring self-driving safety yet difficult to capture in the real world.\nThis had resulted in a reduction of at least 75 per cent in WeRide’s data labelling and collection costs, Han said, adding that such costs made up a large percentage of the company’s R&amp;D spending – around 316 million yuan (US$46 million) in the third quarter of 2025, or around 73 per cent of total operating expenses.\nHan said Genesis was almost entirely the result of advancements in generative AI technology in recent years. The company’s early experiments with physical world simulations had been rudimentary, with cars and pedestrians represented by Roblox-like blocks, limiting practical usefulness.\nThis changed as generative AI, which uses machine learning to create models of its underlying datasets, made virtual worlds increasingly accurate depictions of the real world.\n\nWeRide trained Genesis using billions of kilometres of real-world driving data collected by the company, including more than eight years of real-world edge cases. Its powerful capabilities mean WeRide could sell the model as a stand-alone product in future – a long-standing “dream” for Han, a former chief scientist of autonomous driving at Baidu.\nHan said limits on access to computational power, more than rising graphics processing unit (GPU) prices, were now the main obstacle to continued improvement, given the clear upside of investment in this area for WeRide’s bottom line.\n“Every dollar we spend improving Genesis leads to 10 times more R&amp;D efficiency, because it’s less spent on road testing and recruiting data labourers,” he said, adding they were now “probably” doubling their GPU stock every quarter. “The constraint is the shortage of memory and availability of certain advanced GPUs.”\nWith the help of AI, WeRide aims to ramp up its global fleet from around 1,000 today to up to 3,000 robotaxis by the end of this year.\nHowever, investors have shown concern for WeRide’s future in a crowded field. Apollo Go and Pony.ai aside, Chinese start-ups such as AutoX and Momenta have also recently expanded pilot programmes, while Volkswagen announced this week its plans to launch its first robotaxi fleet in the US.\nSince its November listing, WeRide’s Hong Kong shares have fallen more than 20 per cent, while its Nasdaq shares have slumped almost 70 per cent in the past year. Analysts have highlighted the company’s continued R&amp;D-driven losses as a point of concern, with profitability not expected until 2030.\n\nIt remains uncertain whether Genesis will give WeRide an edge over rivals, with Pony.ai recently touting that its world model PonyWorld generates 10 billion kilometres for testing each week.\nLeading US player Waymo also unveiled its world model earlier this month, built on Google DeepMind’s most powerful world model Genie 3. It said the collaboration with its fellow Alphabet subsidiary gave its model an edge over others in the autonomous vehicle industry, as Genie 3 was trained on a huge number of videos and not just real-world driving data.\nBeyond technical indicators, Han pointed to WeRide’s aggressive global expansion strategy as a differentiator from its competitors, as the strategy could be further enhanced with a powerful world model even if it was not industry-leading.\nWhile WeRide still lags far behind Baidu’s Apollo Go in domestic deployment, the company has already expanded to more than 40 cities across 11 countries and regions, one of the highest in the world, compared with eight for Pony.ai and three for Waymo.\nThe company struck a deal last year with Grab, the largest ride-hailing app in Southeast Asia, and announced a major expansion of its partnership with Uber earlier this month to deploy at least 1,200 robotaxis across the Middle East as soon as 2027.\nMeanwhile, Baidu said on Thursday that Apollo Go had reached 26 cities globally.\n“Genesis for us makes sense from a business expansion perspective,” said Han. “It allows us to more easily get into a new country or market without having to do all the hard work of collecting new road data.”\nWith earnings coming up on March 23, investors could expect to see a Genesis-powered boost to the company’s financial health, he said. “I think we will have very good numbers.”\n",

            "title": "Hong Kong developer Sino Land posts steady profit amid market improvementsChairman Daryl Ng highlights the city’s encouraging property sales performance in the second half of 2025.",
            "description": "Major Hong Kong developer Sino Land posted a steady net profit for the six months ended December, propped up by early gains from a recovery in the city’s residential property market.\nSino Land reported a net profit of HK$2.22 billion (US$284 million) in the first half of its current financial year – excluding revaluation losses on investment properties – that was slightly down from HK$2.24 billion a year earlier, according to its Hong Kong stock exchange filing on Friday.\nThe company’s revenue rose 34.5 per cent to HK$5.19 billion from HK$3.85 billion a year ago. Revenue from property sales, including sales of associates and joint ventures, jumped 2.8 times to HK$6.91 billion from HK$2.45 billion in the same period in 2024.\nTaking into account a HK$682 million revaluation loss on investment properties, the developer earned HK$1.53 billion in the period, down from HK$1.82 billion a year ago.\n“I am encouraged by the clear improvement in both the economic and operating environment,” chairman Daryl Ng Win Kong said in the filing, citing the interest-rate-cut cycle, Hong Kong’s talent admission scheme and mainland China’s national economic blueprint for bolstering the property sector.\nDelivering his first earnings after taking over the chairman role from his father, Ng highlighted the city’s encouraging property sales performance in the second half of 2025, which delivered proceeds of HK$6.5 billion.\nThe developer’s results come as the city’s housing market showed signs of stabilising. Home prices have climbed 3.7 per cent so far this year, according to the Centaline City Leading Index, after gaining 1.6 per cent in January.\n\nTransaction volumes have also strengthened. Primary home sales surged to a seven-year high in January, reaching about 1,500 units – up 101 per cent year on year – while secondary sales hit an eight-year high at 4,100 units, a 44 per cent increase from a year ago.\nSino Land’s shares edged down 0.1 per cent to HK$12.78 on Friday, but rose 25 per cent this year. Out of the 12 analysts’ recommendations of the stock tracked on Bloomberg, 10 suggested “Buy” and two said “Hold”.\nThe company has two new residential projects in the pipeline: one in Tseung Kwan O and another at Wing Kwong Street in To Kwa Wan that is being co-developed with the Urban Renewal Authority.\nLast month, a joint venture between Sino Land and Great Eagle Holdings won a government residential site tender in Kowloon for HK$1.61 billion, outbidding major Hong Kong developers. It followed another tender win in Tuen Mun for HK$1.09 billion last August.\n“With interest rates on a downward trajectory, we will continue to strategically allocate our cash resources and actively pursue opportunities,” Ng said.\nSino Land declared an interim dividend of HK$0.15 per share to be payable either by cash or shares on April 23.\nProfit at the company’s Sino Hotels unit – owner of City Garden Hotel in Fortress Hill, Conrad Hong Kong in Admiralty and the Royal Pacific Hotel &amp; Towers in Tsim Sha Tsui – increased 19.3 per cent in the six months to December to HK$51.9 million from HK$43.5 million a year earlier, according to a separate disclosure.\nTsim Sha Tsui Properties, another listed company under the Sino Group, recorded a 13 per cent drop in profit to HK$905 million from HK$1.04 billion in the year-earlier period.\n",

            "title": "Hong Kong’s small landlords turn to co-working, student hostels to survive",
            "description": "Hong Kong’s struggling office landlords are ramping up efforts to convert their assets into co-working spaces and student accommodation in a bid to adapt to intense competition and the flight to quality, according to analysts.\nWith some 3.5 million sq ft of new premium office space expected to be completed this year and next, on top of the 4.5 million sq ft added in 2024 and 2025, tenants are increasingly choosing to relocate to new and modern offices, leading to diverging fortunes for big established landlords and non-premium asset owners.\n“The persistent ‘flight to quality’ creates a profound and escalating challenge for owners of older, non-prime office buildings,” said Jack Tong, director for research and consultancy at Savills Hong Kong.\n“As corporates from high-value sectors consolidate into modern, ESG [environmental, social and governance]-compliant buildings, the demand for secondary space contracts to smaller local businesses, back-office functions and start-ups – all of which are highly price sensitive and have more options.”\nThis situation is forcing landlords to offer significant rent concessions to keep tenants.\n“For [many] landlords, asset obsolescence is no longer a distant risk but an immediate threat to cash flow and asset viability,” Tong said.\nGiven the situation, proactive landlords are exploring strategies such as repositioning their assets and converting underutilised office floors into co-working spaces and student accommodation.\n“We have seen a recent rebound in co-working space requirements, with total co-working leased floor space amounting to 1.7 million sq ft in 2025, 50 per cent higher than in 2017 when the market was consolidating,” Tong said.\nLandlords were becoming more active in the segment, setting up their co-working operations in their own premises to provide a full leasing ecosystem, according to Tong.\n\nFor example, in 2024, CK Asset Holdings, one of Hong Kong’s largest landlords and developers, launched CK Office Suites to manage a co-working office space on the 45th floor of Cheung Kong Center in Central.\nThe conversion to student housing was also gathering pace because of a huge supply-and-demand imbalance in the sector, according to Savills, which estimated an 88,000-student-bed deficit in Hong Kong currently.\n“The latest Hostel in the City Scheme reveals 25 applications were received under the scheme, involving an addition of 5,100 beds, of which 23 were commercial conversions and two new builds,” Tong said.\nRecently, the owners of Rich China Center, a grade B building in Kwun Tong, applied to the Town Planning Board to convert the asset into a student hostel, providing 117 rooms with a total of 225 beds. The South China Morning Post has reached out to the owners of Rich China Center for comment.\nMeanwhile, the city’s office property market was showing signs of stability, with net absorption of 2.1 million sq ft in 2025, the most since 2018, according to CBRE. Net absorption refers to the total amount of space taken up minus the space left vacant by tenants.\nCentral recorded the biggest improvement with a net absorption of 234,800 sq ft in the fourth quarter, the highest for the city’s main business hub since the second quarter of 2015. Net absorption for the full year stood at 496,000 sq ft, the best annual gain since 2007, CBRE said.\nDespite the pickup in leasing, overall office rents in the city fell 2.9 per cent year on year, the least since 2019, the property consultancy added.\n\n\nDemand mainly came from financial companies, accounting for 69 per cent and 62 per cent of total take-up in the last two quarters of 2025, according to Knight Frank.\nAs a result, premium offices in Central are expected to outperform the broader market this year, with rents likely to rise by as much as 8 per cent, while rents on Hong Kong Island could fall by as much as 5 per cent, Knight Frank added.\nBesides repurposing, small landlords can also survive the tough leasing environment by “enhancing competitiveness through selective and cost-effective upgrades rather than full-scale redevelopment”, said Keith Chan, economist for research and consultancy for Greater China at Knight Frank.\n“Improvements to lobbies, lift systems, building services and ESG-related features can materially uplift tenant perception,” he said.\n“Such repositioning may help capture niche demand from occupiers such as family offices, boutique financial firms and professional services, whose preferences are shifting towards higher-quality, well-managed and more efficient office environments.”\n",

            "title": "The big cornerstone comeback: what’s driving investors back to Hong Kong IPOs?",
            "description": "Until last year, Fidelity International’s most significant cornerstone commitments on the Hong Kong initial public offering (IPO) market dated back to 2021, when Chinese short-video platform Kuaishou Technology raised US$5.4 billion and healthcare firm Medlive Technology completed a US$543.4 million listing.\nThen for the next four years, the asset manager went quiet.\nLate last year it returned to Chinese assets in force. It backed gold miner Zijin Gold International’s US$3.2 billion listing in September 2025, followed by crypto platform HashKey Group, snack retailer Busy Ming and pork giant Muyuan Foods.\nFidelity’s comeback is not an isolated case.\nHeavyweight global investors such as BlackRock, Temasek and Qatar Investment Authority are reappearing in cornerstone books, signalling a shift in sentiment – and raising the question of what has changed in Hong Kong’s favour.\n“We have seen a robust comeback of international long-only investors – especially European and Middle Eastern sovereign funds – in Hong Kong’s IPO market, and we expect that momentum to carry into 2026,” said John Lee, vice-chairman and head of Greater China for global banking at UBS.\nThe return is not limited to Europe and the Middle East, with US and Singapore-based funds also re-emerging as cornerstone backers in major listings, particularly across consumption, industrial and hi-tech sectors.\n“In 2023 and 2024, many international investors reduced China exposure altogether,” Lee said. “But the tone has definitely changed over the past 12 to 18 months, with a gradual return of investors adding back China weightings – a trend that became more pronounced by the middle of 2025.”\nThe shift has been supported by improving sentiment towards consumption, clearer policy direction in technology and industrial upgrading, and growing confidence in the global competitiveness of Chinese companies, particularly in artificial intelligence and advanced manufacturing, he added.\nHong Kong’s equity market delivered its strongest annual gains since 2017 last year, supported by improved liquidity and renewed risk appetite. Benchmarks outpaced several major developed-market indices, while valuations remained well below those of US peers.\nFor investors such as Fidelity International, the move reflects a strong recalibration of risk appetite.\n“The Hong Kong IPO market today feels more anchored by companies listing for longer-term strategic reasons rather than short-term fundraising considerations,” said Tina Tian, portfolio manager at Fidelity International.\nFrom a risk-reward perspective, it felt like the right time to re-engage with Hong Kong, she added, noting that from both an issuer and investor perspective the quality and structure of the IPO pipeline had improved materially.\n“As global regulatory and geopolitical dynamics evolved, a Hong Kong IPO or secondary listing is increasingly seen as a way to broaden the investor base, enhance liquidity and maintain access to international capital within a familiar regulatory framework,” Tian said.\nThe cornerstone investor has long been a steady feature of Hong Kong’s IPO market, offering much-needed ballast to a market prone to sharp swings.\nWith early commitments to buy sizeable stakes and lock-up periods after listing, cornerstone funds anchor pricing, signal confidence and help stabilise deals before trading begins.\nForeign capital accounted for about 27 per cent of all 353 cornerstone investors across the top 20 IPOs of 2025 and those priced up to February 3, this year, according to data compiled by the SCMP.\nTheir presence has grown not only in headcount but also in investment size, with commitments noticeably larger than in 2022.\n“Large scale US funds are leaning into China’s consumption, infrastructure and industrial sectors,” a shift away from their earlier preference for property developers, said George Wu, partner at global law firm DLA Piper.\nThe contrast in cornerstone investor profiles between recent and older deals is stark.\nWhen China Tourism Group Duty Free raised US$2.3 billion in August 2022, the year’s largest IPO in Hong Kong, its cornerstone line-up was dominated by state-backed funds, including China State-owned Enterprise Mixed Ownership Reform Fund and China Structural Reform Fund.\nFast forward to last year, and the names tell a different story.\nMainland Chinese soft drink maker Eastroc Beverage, which raised US$1.3 billion in the city’s largest IPO as of February 3, drew 16 cornerstone investors, including six global heavyweights such as sovereign wealth fund Qatar Investment Authority – the single largest cornerstone investor with US$150 million – alongside Temasek, BlackRock, Fidelity and JPMorgan Asset Management.\nBlackRock put US$35 million into snack retailer Busy Ming. In industrials, Oaktree and Jane Street joined BlackRock in backing machinery maker Sany Heavy Industry, while Jane Street also took a cornerstone stake in air-conditioning components supplier Zhejiang Sanhua Intelligent Controls.\nMiddle Eastern sovereign wealth funds have been among the most active backers of China’s cutting-edge technology listings.\nAbu Dhabi Investment Authority was the largest cornerstone investor in AI start-up MiniMax with a US$65 million commitment and also led the cornerstone line-up in Shenzhen Edge Medical with US$15 million.\nKuwait Investment Authority ranked among the biggest cornerstone investors in battery giant Contemporary Amperex Technology, pledging US$500 million.\n“The direction of private capital flows is driven mainly by financial returns,” Wu said. “But in certain sensitive tech areas, geopolitical and national security concerns inevitably discourage some investors from taking action.”\n\n\n\n\nM&amp;G Investments, the London-based asset manager, was involved last year in the listings of logistics firm Jingdong Industrials and bubble tea chain Mixue Group as a cornerstone investor.\n“Our intention is to be long-term shareholders from the outset,” said Vikas Pershad, portfolio manager for Asian equities at M&amp;G Investments.\n“We see compelling opportunities in several areas: the renewables supply chain, scaled franchise-driven business models expanding domestically and internationally, technology platforms and logistics companies.\n“The common characteristics across these sectors are wide competitive moats, improving unit economics, robust balance sheets, long growth runways and valuations that remain discounted relative to global peers.”\nThe share of IPO proceeds locked up by cornerstone investors also climbed between 2021 and 2026, with the portion of total funds rising to roughly 49 per cent from about 14 per cent, according to LSEG Data &amp; Analytics data.\nMore than 270 global institutions acted as cornerstone investors in Hong Kong IPOs last year, while 40 listings included at least one international cornerstone backer, Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing (HKEX) data showed.\nSo far in 2026, cornerstone tranches have accounted for around half of the US$1.81 billion raised across 11 Hong Kong IPOs.\nFor many global long-only investors, the renewed participation as cornerstone investors marks a clear break from the years when exposure to Chinese equities – and Hong Kong IPOs in particular – was sharply reduced or frozen altogether.\n“That said, state-linked capital helped companies bridge a difficult funding period and reach the IPO stage,” Wu said. “At the same time, local governments were advancing industrial upgrading amid property downturn and sluggish consumption, and companies urgently needed capital between 2022 and 2024. It was a very reasonable match.”\n“The direction of Chinese government capital flows is about supporting local industries, promoting employment and creating local social and economic value,” he added.\nGovernment-backed entities made up about 18 per cent of all cornerstone investors across the largest IPOs of 2025 and those priced up to February 3, this year.\nWhile Chinese government-linked investment vehicles have scaled back their overall share of cornerstone allocations during 2022 and 2024, they continue to anchor the country’s strategic sectors such as artificial intelligence, semiconductors, electric vehicles and new energy.\nAnalysts said their holdings underscored China’s push to shift away from property-driven growth towards new economic engines.\nSeveral semiconductor and biotech deals this year saw meaningful government participation. For instance, cornerstone investors in OmniVision Integrated Circuits, GigaDevice Semiconductor and Shanghai Iluvatar CoreX Semiconductor all included state-linked funds.\nWhile state backing has supported demand in strategic sectors, the broader revival in cornerstone activity has been driven by the return of international investors alongside reforms introduced by Hong Kong’s bourse operator.\nHKEX, which runs Asia’s third-largest stock market with a capitalisation of about US$6.5 trillion, has in recent years introduced a series of listing changes aimed at widening the pipeline of issuers and expanding the base of institutional investors.\n\n\nIts IPO allocation overhaul, effective August 4, guaranteed institutional investors at least 40 per cent of new shares through the bookbuilding tranche while cutting the potential clawback to the retail subscription pool to 35 per cent from 50 per cent under the old rules, a move aimed at reducing volatility in debut trading.\nThe growing prevalence of so-called A+H listings and “return-to-Hong Kong” transactions has also meant that investors are increasingly engaging with companies that are already well researched and subject to regulatory oversight in other major markets, helping to rebuild confidence in deal quality.\nThat shift has been reinforced by changes to the listing regime. Since 2018, HKEX has introduced Chapter 18A and, more recently, Chapter 18C to accommodate pre-revenue biotech and specialist technology companies, widening the pipeline of issuers and drawing fresh pools of capital.\nJohnson Chui, managing director and head of global issuer services at HKEX, said the increasingly diverse mix of participants in IPOs reflected investor confidence in Hong Kong as a resilient and internationally competitive capital-raising venue.\n“HKEX will continue to enhance its attractiveness to global investors,” he said.\nAccording to Peihao Huang, head of equity capital markets for Asia Pacific at J.P. Morgan, cornerstone investors were essential to issuers and banks in setting valuation parameters, identifying opinion-leading institutions and reducing execution risk and helping build momentum during book-building.\nShe added that the presence of well-known international cornerstone investors often strengthened demand from other institutional and retail investors, as their participation was widely viewed as a validation of deal quality and valuation discipline.\n“Cornerstone participation has always been a defining feature of Hong Kong IPOs, but in this cycle it has become the new norm,” she said.\n",

            "title": "Hi-tech aids proposed to help elderly climb stairs to fire-ravaged Tai Po flats",
            "description": "Some anxious residents of fire-ravaged Wang Fuk Court have urged Hong Kong authorities to help them climb stairs using makeshift aids when they return to their high-rise homes to collect personal belongings next month.\nSome lawmakers also proposed on Saturday that the government deploy wearable walking robots, stair-climbing trolleys or wheelchairs to assist elderly residents of the Tai Po estate devastated by the inferno that claimed 168 lives and displaced nearly 5,000 people in November.\nThey raised the suggestions as some worried residents scrambled for ways to navigate the stairs of blocks, which are more than 30 storeys high.\nOne resident said he would write to officials to lobby for the installation of ramps over stairs to ease access and transport of larger items.\nDeputy Chief Secretary Warner Cheuk Wing-hing said on Thursday that residents of the seven fire-damaged blocks could return to collect personal belongings in late April at the earliest.\n\n\n\n\nAccess will be via rear stairs only, as lifts remain inoperative after the fire. Residents have been advised to retrieve only valuable and portable items.\nCheuk said more details could be announced in March.\nA homeowner named Mr Lee suggested placing ramps over the stairs.\n“Officials can’t just sit back and let the victims find the ways on their own,” Lee said.\n“Some residents may have to climb stairs for 20 to 30 storeys to get back home. Even if they can make it to their homes, it is almost impossible to carry belongings down 20 to 30 storeys again.”\nLee added: “We could put 12-inch-wide wooden boards over the stairs to let residents pull up or slide their heavy items or suitcases down the flights of stairs. It won’t cost the government much.”\nHe said he would write to lobby officials.\nLawmaker Scott Leung Man-kwong, deputy chairman of the Legislative Council’s housing panel, agreed the government should offer help.\n“Letting residents return to check their homes is good. But some practical arrangements are needed,” he said.\n“Volunteers from disciplined services could help bring down some heavy stuff. We can also use technology to help, like exoskeletons or stair-climbing trolleys.”\nAn exoskeleton is a wearable motorised robotic frame that enhances the wearer’s strength, endurance and mobility by supporting their joints and muscles. A stair-climbing trolley is a machine with a loading board for transporting heavy or bulky items up or down stairs.\nFellow legislator Michelle Tang Ming-sum, of the Business and Professionals Alliance for Hong Kong, shared Leung’s views.\n“These are common AgeTech devices, readily available on the market. The government can simply rent them,” Tang said.\n\n\nHowever, homeowner David Wong expressed doubt over the need for such equipment.\n“We are not going to bring down a washing machine or a TV set. Understandably, most things inside were already burned to ash,” he said.\n“The government’s move was meant to allow us to go back home to pick up portable and valuable items only,” said Wong, who hoped to be able to retrieve some old family photos.\nAnother owner, Ms Chong, said she would ask her son to go back to check her flat’s condition. “I don’t think I would dare go up. Seeing my home burned to such a state would leave a very painful memory,” she said.\nUndersecretary for Labour and Welfare Ho Kai-ming said ensuring that residents could return home safely was the government’s top priority. “After the plan is finalised, we shall contact the residents through social workers,” Ho said.\nThe fire engulfed seven of Wang Fuk Court’s eight blocks, burning for about 43 hours. The tragedy prompted authorities to provide temporary accommodation to those affected.\nMeanwhile, Food for Good, operator of a transitional housing project in Kai Tak, hosted a Chinese New Year “poon choi” festival meal for Wang FuK Court residents staying there.\nGroup founder Regina Leung Tong Ching-yee, wife of former chief executive Leung Chun-ying, said about 400 affected residents remained there. She said they were welcome to stay longer and that support facilities would be improved.\n",

            "description": "Alibaba Group Holding plans to launch new smart glasses powered by its artificial intelligence assistant Qwen at the coming MWC Barcelona trade show.\nOn Saturday, a company representative confirmed the launch, adding that both online and offline presales would start on Monday, the first day of the annual trade show, formerly known as Mobile World Congress.\nMeanwhile, the company, which owns the South China Morning Post, is preparing a diverse product line-up this year for the global market, including AI rings and AI earphones, according to a person close to the company.\nThe coming release of the Qwen glasses marks Alibaba’s second major foray into smart eyewear. It follows the Quark AI Glasses, priced from 1,899 yuan (US$277), that were officially launched in November 2025, available in the mainland Chinese market.\nThe gadgets target a fast-growing sector. In the first half of 2025, global shipments of smart glasses more than doubled, driven mostly by strong demand for Meta Platform’s glasses, along with new offerings from Xiaomi, according to market research firm Counterpoint.\n\nThe new Alibaba glasses are expected to present a renewed challenge to Meta’s smart eyewear, Ray-Ban Meta, as well as similar wearable devices from Xiaomi and Baidu.\nLast June, Xiaomi launched its own smart glasses priced at 1,999 yuan, while Baidu’s Xiaodu AI Glasses Pro went on sale in November, priced at 2,299 yuan.\nAlibaba has been heavily promoting the Qwen app, which now integrates with its Taobao marketplace, Amap mapping service and travel booking site Fliggy.

            "title": "Applications miss target as 670 Hongkongers settle in UK with BN(O) visa",
            "description": "Nearly 670 Hongkongers have been granted settlement in the United Kingdom under its bespoke BN(O) visa pathway, although the total number of applicants has fallen short of the British government’s lowest “core” estimate five years after its launch.\nWhile tens of thousands of Hongkongers are set to qualify for Indefinite Leave to Remain, or settled status, this year, experts suggested that uncertainties over the UK’s long-term settlement of migrants could deter future applications.\nThe UK introduced the pathway for relevant passport holders in January 2021 in response to the Beijing-imposed national security law.\nWhile the UK announced it would double the permanent settlement qualifying period for migrants to 10 years, Hongkongers on the BN(O) route remain able to qualify for Indefinite Leave to Remain after just five years, followed by citizenship after another year.\nAccording to figures released last week by the Home Office, Britain’s interior ministry, nearly 670 Hongkongers had been granted settlement under the British National (Overseas) route as of the end of 2025.\nIt noted that some individuals may have qualified earlier as time spent on other migration routes counted towards the five-year residence period.\nAccording to the statistics, about 46,900 Hongkongers arrived in the UK under the scheme in its first year of implementation, and thus will soon be able to apply for permanent settlement.\nThe latest figures also show that UK authorities received 191,665 out-of-country BN(O) visa applications between 2021 and 2025, with about 172,000 successful applicants having arrived in the country.\nThe Home Office also recorded about 50,000 in-country extensions over the same period.\nBut those figures fall short of the lowest “core” estimate the Home Office formulated in 2020, ahead of the scheme’s launch, when it compiled an impact assessment related to the estimated social and economic costs of the programme between 2021 and 2025.\nIn the document, the Home Office assessed the cost based on what it called two “core scenarios”, with one estimating 258,000 applications and the other 322,400.\nHeather Rolfe, a senior research fellow with the London-based think tank British Future, said the shortfall was likely due to the previous Conservative government overestimating expected applicants out of “political caution”.\nPrevious UK governments had “significantly underestimated” the interest in other migration schemes, she said.\n“Given that migration is a highly salient and contentious issue in the UK, they would have wanted to avoid that kind of controversy,” she said.\nOther factors affecting interest included that Hongkongers were given other options to resettle, such as in Canada, as well as the costs associated with the visa itself, Rolfe noted.\nShe also expected more applicants to apply for the scheme following a relaxation that was announced earlier this month in light of the sentencing of former media boss Jimmy Lai Chee-ying in his landmark national security trial.\nIn response to Lai’s 20-year term, the Home Office announced that it would expand the scheme to include Hongkongers who were minors at the time of the 1997 handover to China and whose parents had not applied for a BN(O) passport beforehand.\nThe Home Office said it expected 26,000 arrivals under the expanded scheme over the next five years.\nBut Rolfe said “current uncertainty” over the long-term settlement of migrants in the UK could deter further applications in the short term, pointing to an overhaul of the migration model proposed in November.\n\n\nWhile Hongkongers under the BN(O) scheme expressed relief about the unchanged five-year qualifying period, they were plunged back into anxiety after discovering they would be subject to tighter English-language requirements.\nAn income threshold requiring applicants to show earnings of at least £12,570 (US$16,940) for three to five years was also being considered.\nUK Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood previously indicated that any changes were expected to begin to take effect as early as April.\nIn a letter dated February 13, a day after the consultation ended, UK Migration Minister Mike Tapp said the government understood how important the issues were to the Hong Kong community and that it was now “carefully reviewing” the submissions it had received.\n“This analysis will help inform the development of the final earned settlement model, including consideration of any potential exemptions or transitional measures,” he said.\nBrandon To, a Hongkonger who settled in the town of Harrow under the BN(O) scheme, shared the minister’s letter on X, writing: “We are delighted to hear that the government is finally considering ‘transitional measures’.\n“We look forward to more concrete promises from the government to protect Hongkongers’ rights in the UK.”\n",
