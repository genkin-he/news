            "description": "US President Donald Trump on Friday denied he was considering strikes inside Venezuela, appearing to contradict his own comments from last week and amid intensifying expectations that Washington may soon expand drug-trafficking-related operations.\\nThe US has built up a large military presence in the Caribbean in recent months, with fighter aircraft, warships and thousands of troops. That presence will significantly expand in the coming weeks with the arrival of the Gerald Ford aircraft carrier strike group.\\nOn Friday, when asked by reporters on Air Force One if media reports that he was considering strikes within Venezuela were true, Trump said: “No.”\\nIt was not immediately clear if Trump was ruling out future strikes inside Venezuela or simply saying no final decision had been made yet.\\nIn recent weeks, Trump has publicly said that his administration will carry out strikes against drug-related targets inside Venezuela. “The land is going to be next,” Trump told reporters last week.\\n\\nThe US campaign in the Caribbean and eastern Pacific has already targeted at least 14 boats that Washington said were involved in the illegal drug trade, killing 61 people.\\nWhile the exact timing of any land strikes is unclear, officials close to Trump had suggested it could be soon.\\nSenator Lindsey Graham, a senior Republican lawmaker, said on Sunday that Trump had told him the administration planned to brief lawmakers on military operations against Venezuela and Colombia when he returned from his trip to Asia.\\nTrump returned to Washington on Thursday.\\nA US official, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said the military had provided a range of options, including strikes against military facilities inside Venezuela, such as runways. That is not a surprise given the nexus between Venezuela’s military and drug trafficking.\\nThe Venezuelan opposition, watchdog groups and some Latin American neighbours have long accused the Venezuelan government – especially the military – of having ties to the drug trade, particularly in the country’s west, along the border with Colombia. President Nicolas Maduro’s government has always denied any criminal connections.\\nMaduro has repeatedly alleged that the US is hoping to drive him from power.\\n",

No opposition candidates have entered the fray so far.\\nIn 2021, the bids of all 11 centrists or hopefuls with a previous opposition background who ran in the geographical constituencies were in vain, as major pan-democrat parties did not take part in the poll.\\nThe middle-of-the-road Third Side party, which fielded one candidate in the geographical constituencies in 2021, has yet to announce its line-up.\\nThird Side chairman and outgoing lawmaker Tik Chi-yuen told the Post that the party was still reaching out to various sectors in a bid to secure enough nominations.\\nDistrict councillor Allan Wong Wing-ho of the POD Research Institute, formerly known as Path of Democracy founded by Executive Council member Ronny Tong Ka-wah, has signed up to run in the New Territories North East constituency. He did not declare a political affiliation when he signed up.\\nThe number of candidates fielded by major pro-establishment parties in the direct election, meanwhile, has more than doubled from 16 in 2021 to 35 this year.\\nThe Democratic Alliance for the Betterment and Progress of Hong Kong, the city’s largest party, is fielding 13 candidates, up from 10 in 2021.\\nThe Hong Kong Federation of Trade Unions and the New People’s Party have nine and seven hopefuls, respectively, compared with three-candidate slates previously.\\n\\nThe pro-business Liberal Party and the Business and Professionals Alliance for Hong Kong, which did not field any candidates in geographical constituencies in the 2021 race, are going to do so this time.\\nChief Executive John Lee Ka-chiu said on Tuesday that he expected a “fierce but healthy rivalry” to drum up residents’ interest and engagement in the election.\\nEmeritus Professor John Burns of the University of Hong Kong said the government’s priority was to boost voter turnout and enhance the legitimacy of Beijing’s “patriots-only” electoral system.\\nBurns said that a more competitive race could drive up the turnout rate. However, the room for growth would be limited due to the absence of democrats.\\n“The competition is limited to a narrow range of pro-establishment opinion and does not represent the diversity of opinions we had in the past,” Burns said, adding that around 55 to 60 per cent of voters used to support pan-democratic candidates in previous elections until 2021.\\nThe first poll under Beijing’s “patriots-only” system in 2021 saw a turnout of 30.2 per cent in the geographical constituencies, the lowest since 1991.\\nLau Siu-kai, a consultant for the semi-official Chinese Association of Hong Kong and Macau Studies think tank, said the rising number of hopefuls in the geographical constituencies showed that the new electoral system had managed to attract more candidates to come out and contribute to the city.\\n“Now they know that they can make concrete contributions for the benefit of Hong Kong without getting into unnecessary political struggles, many will become more willing to run,” he said.\\nAmong the 10 constituencies, Kowloon Central is the most hotly contested, with six candidates running for two seats.\\nStarry Lee Wai-king, the city’s sole representative on the National People’s Congress Standing Committee, the country’s top legislative body, and Kitson Yang Wing-kit are eyeing another term representing the constituency.\\nWhile five candidates are contesting the two seats on Hong Kong Island West, three are incumbent lawmakers, implying that at least one will not be re-elected.\\nRegina Ip Lau Suk-yee, convenor of the city’s top decision-making Executive Council, who held one of its two seats, earlier announced her exit from Legco.\\n\\nIn the run-up to the election, a wave of lawmakers opted not to seek re-election, meaning a massive reshuffle in Legco is coming. A total of 28, or 31 per cent, of the city’s 89 legislators decided to step down, a record high since the city’s return to Chinese sovereignty in 1997. The number includes all 12 members aged 70 and above.\\nPrevious elections typically saw 10 to 20 per cent of incumbents not seeking re-election.\\nDistrict councillors have emerged as a key “talent pool” to fill the vacancies in geographical constituencies, with all but two of the 34 new contenders currently serving on district councils.\\nSo far, 134 people had officially submitted their nomination forms for the December 7 race, with 46 vying for geographical constituencies, 49 for the functional constituencies and 39 for the Election Committee constituency.\\nThe nomination period closes on November 6.\\nAdditional reporting by Willa Wu\\n",

            "title": "PLA team releases photo of hypersonic ‘morphing’ missile that can change shape at Mach 5",
            "description": "Chinese military scientists have unveiled a rare glimpse into one of the most advanced frontiers of aerospace technology: a prototype of a morphing hypersonic vehicle capable of flying at speeds exceeding Mach 5.\\nThe missile, revealed in a published peer-reviewed paper, features a pair of retractable wings – a groundbreaking design that allows it to dynamically adapt its aerodynamic profile mid-flight.\\nWhen stowed inside the fuselage, the wings minimise drag for high-speed cruising. When extended, they generate additional lift and significantly improve manoeuvrability.\\nCrucially, the degree of wing deployment can be finely adjusted, enabling real-time changes to the vehicle’s overall aerodynamic shape and flight characteristics – a capability long considered the “holy grail” of hypersonic flight.\\nThe design was detailed in a paper published on October 20 in Acta Aeronautica et Astronautica Sinica, China’s leading aerospace journal, by a research team led by Professor Wang Peng from the College of Aerospace Science and Engineering at the National University of Defence Technology (NUDT).\\nThe study confirmed the vehicle’s novel control algorithms and key components had successfully passed hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) ground tests – a critical milestone indicating the system is not just theoretical, but viable for real-world deployment.\\n“High-speed morphing vehicles represent a cutting-edge direction in next-generation aerospace platforms,” the authors wrote.\\n\\n\\n“By dynamically adjusting their structure during flight to adapt to varying aerodynamic conditions, these vehicles demonstrate exceptional adaptability across wide speed and altitude ranges, offering significant potential for multi-role missions and enhanced penetration capabilities.\\n“Compared to traditional fixed-geometry high-speed vehicles, morphing vehicles can optimise aerodynamic performance in response to complex flight environments, dramatically improving manoeuvrability and mission flexibility.”\\nFor years, Chinese scientists have claimed their hypersonic weapons can target not only fixed installations but also highly mobile assets, including advanced stealth fighters like the F-22 and B-21 bomber.\\nThese assertions were met with scepticism – and even ridicule – from many Western experts, who long operated under the assumption that hypersonic missiles sacrifice manoeuvrability for speed. The prevailing dogma held that the faster a vehicle flies, the harder it is to steer.\\nBut China appears to have shattered that paradigm. During a massive parade on September 3, Beijing showcased the Changjian-1000 (CJ-1000) hypersonic cruise missile – a weapon reportedly capable of striking ground targets and engaging moving maritime threats such as aircraft carriers and airborne early-warning aircraft thousands of kilometres away, even if those targets attempt evasive manoeuvres.\\nDespite intense global speculation that the CJ-1000 employs morphing technology to achieve such unprecedented versatility, the missile was displayed fully enclosed in a protective canister, revealing no visible details.\\nNow, Wang’s research offers an extremely rare window into this once-secret technology.\\nControlling a vehicle at hypersonic speeds is inherently difficult. At Mach 5 and above, surface temperatures can exceed 2,000 degrees Celsius (3,632 Fahrenheit), triggering extreme physical and chemical changes in the airframe. Introducing morphing structures – like moving wings – multiplies the complexity.\\nThe shifting geometry generates massive uncertainty in aerodynamic models, demanding extraordinary computational power to calculate stable control commands in real time.\\n\\n\\nYet hypersonic platforms operate under severe constraints: limited on-board power, tight payload space and unforgiving battlefield conditions. The on-board flight computers, while highly reliable, cannot match the processing power of ground-based systems.\\nAs a result, control algorithms must be lightweight, ultra-efficient and resilient – capable of making split-second decisions with minimal delay.\\nEven more challenging is that mechanical actuators moving the wings are subject to inherent lag. Without precise control, these movements can induce high-frequency, destructive vibrations – a phenomenon known as “control chattering”, which can damage the vehicle or destabilise flight.\\nSuppressing such oscillations remains one of the most formidable challenges in morphing vehicle development worldwide.\\nWang’s team has now demonstrated a revolutionary control algorithm specifically designed to overcome these barriers.\\nTheir approach integrates high-order fully actuated system modelling, prescribed performance control and super-twisting sliding mode control – a sophisticated fusion of techniques that achieves high precision and robustness while drastically reducing computational load.\\nCritically, the algorithm has been verified in hardware-in-the-loop experiments, proving it can run in real time on embedded flight processors, similar to those used in actual missiles. In tests, the system achieved attitude tracking errors under 1 degree, with smooth, chatter-free actuator responses – validating its readiness for real-flight applications.\\nBeyond military use, morphing hypersonic technology holds transformative potential for civil aviation: enabling intercontinental flights in an hour or two, point-to-point global transport and efficient space access vehicles for reusable launch systems.\\nYet significant engineering challenges remain. The prototype photo reveals visible gaps where the wings extend – raising questions about thermal sealing under extreme heat, structural integrity and stealth performance.\\nKey challenges include preventing scorching plasma from penetrating the fuselage and minimising the radar cross-section despite moving parts.\\n",

Thanks to Donald Trump finding a way to pay our troops last month, that pain was delayed,” Republican House Whip Tom Emmer told Fox News. “But, starting this week … this is starting to become very real.”\\nAt the heart of the fight is money to help Americans cover health insurance under the Affordable Care Act, better known as “Obamacare”.\\n\\nThose subsidies – a lifeline for more than 20 million people – are set to expire at year’s end and, unless Congress acts, premiums will skyrocket by an eye-watering average of 114 per cent when the new sign-up period opens Saturday.\\nBut Washington’s warring parties are locked in a familiar, bitter loop, as Democrats refuse to reopen the government without a deal to extend the subsidies and Trump’s Republicans saying they won’t talk until the lights are back on.\\nAs Washington bickers, the shutdown’s fallout is rippling through everyday life and starting to pinch where it really hurts – the dinner table.\\nThe Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), which helps 42 million low-income Americans buy groceries, is set to run out of funds this weekend.\\nDemocrats have been pushing the White House to use US$5 billion in emergency cash to cover food stamps, but the administration says it cannot legally tap that fund.\\n\\nGlimmers of hope?\\nWith no end to the shutdown in sight, the deadlines are piling up fast.\\nWIC – the food aid programme for pregnant women, new mothers and infants – is also on the brink, while “Head Start” programmes that provide nutrition and family support to 65,000 infants could begin shuttering from Saturday.\\nThe administration says it has scraped together enough money to cover Friday’s payday for active-duty troops, but acknowledges that they could go unpaid by mid-November.\\nSome 670,000 federal workers have been sent home without pay, and another 730,000 – from park rangers to air traffic controllers – are working for nothing.

But even that has become political quicksand, with Democrats holding the line.\\nStill, there are faint signs of life on Capitol Hill.\\nAfter weeks of political trench warfare, a handful of centrist Democrats and pragmatic Republicans have quietly started sketching possible compromises, most hingeing on a commitment to tackle healthcare once the government reopens.\\nSome Democrats are signalling openness to smaller bills to pay workers or keep food aid flowing – signs that both sides may be feeling the heat.\\n\\nAnd looming somewhere in the wings is Trump, whose shadow hangs over every Republican move. Lawmakers on both sides hope he’ll swoop in to broker a deal on the Obamacare subsidies.\\nIn a rare intervention in the crisis, Trump called on Thursday for the Senate to scrap its 60-vote threshold for legislation to pass, which would strip Democrats of all their leverage.\\nHe admonished Republicans on social media that “WE are in power, and if we did what we should be doing, it would IMMEDIATELY end this ridiculous, Country destroying ‘SHUT DOWN.’”\\nAmericans blame Trump and the Republicans over Democrats, by 45 per cent to 33 per cent, according to the latest ABC/Washington Post poll.

            "description": "The leaders of China and Canada held their first formal talks since 2017 on Friday, with both sides agreeing to revive exchanges and cooperation in an effort to repair strained ties.\\nChinese President Xi Jinping met Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney on the sidelines of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (Apec) summit in Gyeongju, South Korea, telling him that relations showed a “trend of recovery and positive development” following their nations’ mutual efforts.\\n“[China] is willing to work with Canada to take this meeting as an opportunity to bring China-Canada relations back onto the right track,” Xi said, according to the state news agency, Xinhua.\\n\\n\\nThe Chinese leader added that China and Canada should view each other “correctly” and expand cooperation in areas ranging from trade and economy to energy while deepening people-to-people exchanges. The Xinhua report said the two leaders agreed to push to resolve economic issues.\\nCarney said the new Canadian government highly valued its ties with Beijing, looked forward to restarting bilateral cooperation and sought to “make up for lost time”, a reference to heightened tensions between the two countries in recent years, according to Xinhua.\\nAn official Canadian statement said the two leaders agreed that the talks – which Canadian media said lasted 39 minutes – marked a “turning point in the bilateral relationship”, and they committed to renewing ties in a pragmatic way.\\n“Both leaders directed their officials to move quickly to resolve outstanding trade issues and irritants,” the statement from Ottawa said, adding that Carney had accepted Xi’s invitation to visit China at a mutually convenient time.\\nThe meeting came on the back of years of fraught ties between China and Canada, partly stemming from the 2018 tit-for-tat arrests of Huawei Technologies executive Meng Wanzhou in Vancouver at the request of the US, and two Canadians living in China accused of espionage.\\nCanada had said Beijing was carrying out “hostage diplomacy” during a stand-off that only ended in 2021 when a deal with US prosecutors led to the release of Meng and the Canadians Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor.\\nTensions escalated further in 2023 amid allegations of Chinese interference in Canadian elections and attempts to intimidate lawmakers, culminating in the expulsion of a Chinese diplomat.\\nTrade ties have also remained tense. Last year, former prime minister Justin Trudeau aligned with Washington in imposing 100 per cent tariffs on Chinese electric vehicles. China retaliated by slapping duties on canola, pork and seafood.\\nThe meeting on Friday indicated an effort by Carney, who became prime minister in March, to repair ties with Beijing as his own country navigates an increasingly complex relationship with the US.\\nCanada has been working on a tariff deal with US President Donald Trump but the American leader last week said he was ending negotiations with Ottawa after a Canadian province aired a television ad featuring former president Ronald Reagan that criticised the tariffs.\\n\\n\\nAhead of his meeting with Xi, Carney told reporters, “We will explore what we can build on”.\\n“This is our second-largest trading partner. This is the second-largest economy in the world,” Carney said. “This is one of the most influential actors in terms of the global system, such as it is, and it is a country with whom we had no senior-level contact for seven years.”\\nXi, who is on a three-day visit to South Korea until Saturday, also met Japan’s Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi and Thailand’s Prime Minister Anutin Charnvirakul on Friday and is expected to meet other world leaders, including South Korean President Lee Jae-myung.\\nEarlier on Friday, Xi delivered remarks to leaders at the Apec meeting where he called on them to stabilise and protect global supply chains.\\nAustralian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese posted a photograph of himself shaking hands with Xi on social media with the caption: “Good to meet informally with President Xi at the Apec Summit in South Korea today”.\\n",

He added that air pollution was one of the most urgent environmental problems in the region, and posed a significant health burden.\\n\\nIn 2019, there were 1,147,259 premature deaths caused by air pollution in Southeast Asia, costing the region US$432 billion, the study said.\\nAccording to the World Health Organization, long-term exposure to pollutants increases the risks of heart diseases, stroke and cancer.\\nA medium level of emissions presented the most optimistic scenario, where economic loss was estimated at US$246 billion, and premature deaths projected to fall 1.8 per cent from 2019.\\nThis was because in this scenario, the region would experience slightly warmer temperatures with a modest increase in rainfall and humidity, and such wetter conditions would support the removal of pollutants, Yim told This Week in Asia.\\nIn comparison, the lowest emissions scenario would see a lower temperature and lesser rainfall – a favourable climate for the formation of PM2.5, which are fine particulates of less than 2.5 microns.\\nAccording to a 2019 study by the World Bank, air pollution caused 6.4 million premature deaths that year, with death rates significantly higher in low- and lower-middle-income countries. The estimated cost of health damage associated with air pollution was US$8.1 trillion – 6.1 per cent of global GDP.\\nIn 2020, air pollution led to 40,000 deaths and cost Tokyo US$43 billion, according to Swiss air quality tracker IQAir. In Shanghai in 2020, air pollution caused 39,000 deaths and the city lost US$19 billion.\\n\\n\\nThe new research by Yim’s team showed that despite estimated increases in deaths and economic loss, PM2.5 concentration was projected to decrease regionally.\\nYim noted that while some areas might experience lower concentration levels due to higher temperatures inducing rainfall, hotspots in Indonesia and Thailand would continue to experience an increase in pollution levels, and drive health and economic burden.\\nThese include subregions such as southern Indonesia and southern Thailand, which are densely populated and experience lesser rainfall, leading to the accumulation of pollutants.\\nThe study estimated that among all states, Indonesia and Thailand would experience the highest economic losses and increase in premature deaths across all emissions scenarios.\\nIndonesia is expected to lose US$307 billion and US$213 billion in the high and low emissions scenarios respectively, while Thailand’s projected losses stand at US$121 billion and US$101 billion.\\nWhile air pollution is a global issue, its impacts are felt unevenly with developing countries likely to experience a greater economic burden, according to Joseph Sung, co-author of the study.\\nEconomic loss included direct costs such as healthcare, as well as indirect costs such as the labour and productivity loss, said Sung, the dean of NTU’s Lee Kong Chian School of Medicine.\\n“The air pollution situation in developing countries is already more serious, and yet there’s a lot of room for improvement in their healthcare systems,” Sung told This Week in Asia. “Those who suffer from complications take longer to get better, or not at all, so the economic impact can be much higher than developed countries.”\\n\\nYim said the findings highlighted the need to consider localised characteristics for climate mitigation policies.\\n“For example, current climate mitigation policies, such as using alternative fuels to lower carbon dioxide emissions, may inadvertently exacerbate health and economic burdens in vulnerable regions,” he said.\\nYim also called for greater regional collaboration in tackling the impacts of air pollution, adding that pollution in Southeast Asia was often transboundary.\\nThe region experiences recurring periods of transboundary haze, and Malaysia and Singapore are often the worst hit during the dry season, when forest fires plague Indonesia.\\n",

            "title": "Dutch knife-edge election won by centrist party, as Wilders far-right party faces defeat",
            "description": "The centrist D66 party won the knife-edge Dutch election, local news agency ANP projected on Friday, saying its vote tally showed far-right leader Geert Wilders could not close the gap.\\nThat would put D66 leader Rob Jetten on track to become the youngest leader of the European Union’s fifth-largest economy, but lengthy coalition negotiations lie ahead.\\nANP’s projections were immediately cited by multiple Dutch news outlets, including public broadcaster NOS.\\nWith just one constituency and overseas postal votes still to be counted, Jetten holds a razor-thin lead of 15,155 votes over Wilders.\\nThe postal votes are already being counted in The Hague, but the result will not be announced before Monday evening at the earliest.\\n\\nExpats have historically broken for more centrist and left-wing parties. At the last election in 2023, D66 outscored the PVV by nearly 3,000 postal votes.\\nOn Tuesday, top politicians will come together in parliament to elect a so-called “scout”, who will sound out parties to see who is prepared to work with whom.\\nThe leader of the party with the most votes picks the scout and takes the lead in the arduous coalition-building process, which will last several months.\\nUntil then, caretaker Prime Minister Dick Schoof remains in charge. “I expect I will still be PM at Christmas,” he said earlier on Friday.\\nAll parties have excluded Wilders, who torpedoed the last coalition by pulling out the PVV in a row over immigration.\\n\\nGrand coalition\\nIf confirmed as election winner, Jetten must form a coalition of like-minded parties with a majority of at least 76 seats in the 150 member parliament.\\nHis main path to that appears to be a form of “grand coalition” with the centre-right CDA (18 seats), the liberal VVD (22) and the left-wing Green/Labour group (20). Jetten’s D66 party has 26 seats.\\nBut there are question marks about whether the VVD and Green/Labour will work together.\\nVVD leader Dilan Yesilgoz said before the election, an alliance with Green/Labour “would not work”, and she wanted a centre-right coalition.\\nOn Monday, the Green/Labour group will elect a new leader after former EU vice-president Frans Timmermans stepped down.\\nYesilgoz and Timmermans are known to have a difficult relationship, so a new Green/Labour leader could ease the path to a partnership.\\nAlthough Wilders saw support collapse, other far-right parties performed well.\\nThe Forum for Democracy (FvD), a nationalist party that wants to withdraw from the EU’s Schengen system of open borders, more than doubled its vote.\\nIt will have seven MPs in the new parliament, from three before. Wilders has ruled out working with them, finding them too extreme.\\nThe hard-right JA21 party, which has described itself as a “conservative liberal party with a positive view of the Netherlands”, jumped from one seat to nine.\\n",
