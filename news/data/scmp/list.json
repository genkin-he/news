            "description": "US President Donald Trump said on Friday that he had renovated the Lincoln Bedroom’s bathroom, putting his latest stamp on the White House after demolishing the East Wing, paving over the Rose Garden and decorating the Oval Office in gold.\\nTrump, who has drawn criticism from preservationists and Democrats for adding a Mar-a-Lago-style sheen to the historic mansion, unveiled the remodelled white-and-black-marbled bathroom via social media.\\n“I renovated the Lincoln Bathroom in the White House. It was renovated in the 1940s in an art deco green tile style, which was totally inappropriate for the Lincoln Era,” Trump said in his post, which included photos of the bathroom before and after the renovation.\\n“I did it in black and white polished Statuary marble,” he said. “This was very appropriate for the time of Abraham Lincoln and, in fact, could be the marble that was originally there!”\\nThe White House did not immediately respond to questions about whether the bathroom project had undergone any formal design or approval process.\\n\\nTrump’s abrupt demolition of the East Wing this month to make way for a 8,360-square-metre (90,000-square-foot) ballroom has been criticised for not first going through a proper review.\\nThe White House has said it would submit plans for the ballroom construction for review by the National Capital Planning Commission, which is chaired by Trump’s staff secretary.\\nWhile US presidents over the decades have remodelled rooms in their living space, Trump, a former New York real estate tycoon, has sought to remake the White House with particular gusto.\\nSince taking office in January, Trump has put gold adornments and statuettes in the Oval Office, in a style he prefers. The grass in the Rose Garden was dug up and paved over with white stone.\\nPortraits of Trump have been hung throughout the property, and giant American flags erected on new flagpoles on the north and south lawns.\\nThe green-tiled Lincoln bathroom dated back to a White House renovation conducted by then-President Harry Truman in the 1950s, according to a Washington Post article from 2007.\\nAt the time, then-President George W. Bush and first lady Laura Bush undertook a renovation of the Lincoln Bedroom, which Lincoln used as an office. The Post article describing the Bush renovation said they had left alone the “well-preserved” bathroom.\\n",

            "description": "Arooj Aftab became the first Pakistani Grammy winner when she took home the global music performance award for her song “Mohabbat” in 2022.\\nA year later, actor and singer Diljit Dosanjh stepped onto the smoke-filled stage of the Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival in Southern California, becoming the festival’s first artist from the Indian state of Punjab.\\nIn August, the first-generation Indian-American artist Avara sat in a bed of rose petals at a concert hall in Brooklyn, New York, for the opening performance of her first tour. Fans crowded around the stage for a glimpse of the artist, who has gained over 250,000 new monthly Spotify listeners since November 2024 – a more than 250 per cent increase.\\n“I started getting a bunch of her TikToks,” said audience member Alex Kim, a 22-year-old music assistant. “Everyone has a short attention span these days, but I was like, ‘Wait a minute, I actually really like this.’”\\nFollowing Afrobeat, K-pop and Latin music, songs with South Asian influences are the latest global trend around the world. In April, Warner Music Group launched 5 Junction Records, a label dedicated to selling South Asian-influenced artists to North American listeners.\\n“It’s something that’s been forming slowly,” Billboard CEO Mike Van said about the overseas surge of South Asian-influenced artists. “We started to see these growth spurts over the last couple of years because of all the technology, evolving tastes and activation of these diaspora audiences.”\\n\\nJuergen Grebner, the general manager of 5 Junction Records, said that his label looks for artists with strong fan bases in their home countries. A No 1 song in India “automatically will chart in the Top 20 on Spotify’s global charts”, he said.\\nBorn to Moroccan parents in Toronto, Canada, actress-turned-singer Nora Fatehi performed at the Fifa World Cup 2022, and billions worldwide watched the closing ceremony in Qatar. A Toronto talent agency had encouraged her to explore opportunities in India, and she moved there 11 years ago, learned Hindi and began auditioning for every modelling and acting role she could find, determined to make a name for herself.\\n“The Indian audience is the reason why I am what I am today. So while I’m making myself into a global artist, I’m bringing them with me,” Fatehi said.\\nIn the multibillion-dollar global music business, musicians often need to team up with local artists or brands to expand beyond their popularity at home, Grebner said.\\n“The only way really to win in those markets is to collaborate,” he said.\\nThe international girl group Katseye features members of Indian, Japanese and Filipino descent who starred in a recent Gap advertisement.\\nFatehi’s single “Snake”, featuring US pop and R&amp;B singer Jason Derulo, reached the top 20 on Spotify charts in both the UK and Canada.\\n\\n\\nSome music from India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Nepal, Bhutan, Sri Lanka and the Maldives evolved as a way to teach Buddhism, Hinduism, Sikhism and other spiritual teachings thousands of years ago, said Professor Francesca Cassio, chair of the music department at Hofstra University in New York. One North Indian classical genre, khyal, gained popularity in the West during the 1960s as sitar great Ravi Shankar influenced musicians, including the Beatles and John Coltrane.\\nAs the US becomes increasingly diverse, it has been encouraging to see younger audiences showing an “overall acceptance of global sounds”, Van said.\\nVan pointed out that Gen Z and Gen Alpha are leading the charge in embracing music that crosses cultural lines.\\n“Artists have a direct connection now to their fans,” said Van. “You’ve got clips now, literally edited down to 10 seconds or less, that are capturing people’s attention that can go viral. And so it’s a new way of not only promotion, but also again, consumption and discovery.”\\n\\nAvara gained a social media following by posting videos that blend her meditative R&amp;B and soul music with elements of her years of Indian classical and Western vocal training.\\nIn Marietta, in the US state of Georgia, she grew up feeling “never a part of the brown community but never completely a part of the American community”, she said.\\n“I was around a lot of white people and people that didn’t look like me, and I rejected a lot of parts of myself,” she said.\\nHer debut album, a softer place to land, honoured the artistic community that shaped her over the past two years. Her next project, Mara, is about reclaiming her identity as a “young brown girl” through the lens of a “third-culture kid” – someone who grows up balancing their parents’ heritage with the cultures they are raised in, she said.\\nShe described her next album as a mixture of every culture that has influenced her over the past 25 years, blending Indian vocal riffs with Spanish guitar, reggae and other styles.\\n“I’m trying to create something completely different,” she said. “I’m trying to create a new genre with this stuff that comes from those influences of what I learned as a kid.”\\n",

            "title": "Hong Kong civil servants should do their civic duty and vote in Legco election",
            "description": "Halfway into the two-week nomination period for the Legislative Council elections, the Hong Kong government is doing its best to get out the vote. This includes staging an extensive publicity campaign and making an appeal to civil servants to support the ballot next month. In a letter to the 171,000-strong civil service on Tuesday, Chief Executive John Lee Ka-chiu strongly urged all civil servants to cast their votes on December 7.\\nCiting the Civil Service Code, which requires government employees to support the local administration’s governance, he said voting was a “manifestation of civil servants upholding” the Basic Law and their allegiance to the city as pledged in their oaths. “As the backbone of the government, civil servants should set an example and cast votes in elections to fulfil their civic responsibility,” Lee said in the letter.\\nThis is not the first time civil servants have been reminded to vote as part of their duty to support the administration. Lee stopped short of saying whether those who did not vote would be punished. When asked if the government was hoping the turnout rate in the geographical polls would surpass the 30.2 per cent in 2021 – the lowest since Hong Kong’s return to Chinese rule – Lee stressed there was “no hard target”.\\nThe appeal must not be seen as civil servants being pressured to vote. There is also no question of their political neutrality being compromised, as they were not asked to vote for a particular party or candidate. As stipulated in the Civil Service Code, government employees have a duty to support the chief executive’s policies and his governance. They should also lead by example and demonstrate to the public that voting is a civic duty.\\nSpeaking last week at the launch of the election process, Lee also called on the private sector to encourage their employees to vote. “I strongly urge all sectors of society, including various institutions, businesses, organisations and groups, to fulfil their social responsibility by encouraging employees to vote on polling day, and offering them support where feasible,” he said.\\nAs reported by the Post, some businesses and public bodies are heeding his call. For instance, Sino Group will grant its staff members half a day’s leave to encourage them to vote. Hopefully, more companies and institutions will do their part to facilitate the vote.\\nThe government should work harder to promote the election among different sectors, and encourage voters to make use of their ballots to bring better governance and a better future for Hong Kong and the country. Candidates should also do their part in appealing to voters by coming up with solid policy initiatives.\\n",

            "title": "On Taiwan, the ‘one-China principle’ is the bottom line",
            "description": "The Communist Party’s fourth plenum communique reaffirmed the promotion of peaceful development of relations across the Taiwan Strait and advancement of the cause of national reunification. Within a day, the National People’s Congress Standing Committee designated October 25 as the annual day of commemoration of Taiwan’s return to Chinese sovereignty – 80 years after the surrender of Japanese forces in Taiwan to the then ruling Kuomintang.\\nThis sends a telling message. The Beijing leadership sees the return of Taiwan to China after 50 years of Japanese occupation as part of the process of reunification. The commemoration is therefore a significant national event. It means that Taiwan has always been part of the Chinese nation. The bottom line is that so long as Taiwan recognises the one-China principle, anything is negotiable.\\nIn contrast to the plenum, the Taiwan issue did not arise in official accounts of Thursday’s summit between Chinese President Xi Jinping and US President Donald Trump. That Trump omitted or forgot it should be a timely reminder to pro-independence forces that one China is the reality they have to accept. The decision on the October 25 commemoration dovetailed with the party’s call to “advance the great cause of national reunification” as part of the 15th five-year plan. The plenum communique urged the party to “work for long-term prosperity and stability in Hong Kong and Macau, promote peaceful development of relations across the Taiwan Strait and advance the cause of national reunification”. That resonates with an official commentary since published by state news agency Xinhua, that after peaceful reunification, Taiwan’s current social system and way of life would be fully respected, with “patriots governing Taiwan”.\\nThe one-China principle remains the bottom line. No one wants to see forced reunification but Beijing cannot rule it out so as to deter any independence attempt. Taiwan should accept that reunification will happen sooner or later. Dialogue with Beijing can foster mutual trust and consensus. Under new chairwoman Cheng Li-wun, the current opposition party KMT should play a more proactive role in promoting cross-strait relations. Meanwhile, the return of Taiwan to China 80 years ago should be commemorated by all Chinese people.\\n",

            "title": "Trump hails ‘lasting’ deal with Xi, dangles more possible tariff cuts",
            "description": "Just back from his whirlwind Asia tour, US President Donald Trump on Friday hailed a newly negotiated trade deal with China as a “long-lasting” victory even as he teased the possibility of more tariff concessions.\\nAboard Air Force One en route to his Palm Beach, Florida, resort, Trump painted the Busan, South Korea, summit with Chinese President Xi Jinping on Thursday as a blockbuster for US agriculture, especially soybeans, and dangled the prospect of stronger trade ties.\\n“The deal with China is going to be wonderful. It’s going to be long lasting,” Trump said, crediting his personal rapport with Xi for the success. “I got along with President Xi very well … The meeting with China was incredible.”\\nDespite Trump’s chest-thumping, analysts said there are serious questions about the agreement that leave ample room for misunderstanding, misinterpretation and a slide into another downward spiral and do not address some of the most significant irritants in the US-China relationship.\\n“The rivalry’s structural fault lines remain intact,” said Han Lin, Shanghai-based China managing director with the Asia Group. “Unsurprisingly, both leaders are playing to their bases, not building lasting peace.”\\n\\n\\nThursday’s pact, building on a framework announced earlier in the week, averts a threatened escalation in the trade war and secures a pledge by China to buy at least 25 million tons (25.4 million metric tonnes) of US soybeans annually for the next three years, along with sorghum and other farm products.\\nTrump has boasted that the deals made in Asia are bringing in “over US$3 trillion really, in profit”, telling farmers to “go out and buy larger tractors and more land” in anticipation of the windfall.\\nAfter reaching a 15-month high on trade-deal optimism a day earlier, soybean futures slipped Wednesday as US farmers took profits from the previous session’s rally.\\nThe agreement also tackles Beijing’s rare earth export curbs, crucial for US tech and defence. China has agreed to pause these restrictions for a year, with Trump hinting on Thursday that the truce could be “very routinely extended”.\\nIn return, the US cut fentanyl-related tariffs on Chinese imports from 20 per cent to 10 per cent, framing it as an incentive for Beijing to curb illicit opioid production.\\n“I’ve given China great incentives to hold down the fentanyl, get rid of it,” Trump said on Friday, noting its medical uses while blasting its illicit trade.\\n“I really believe that they have an incentive,” he added. “I’d love to get rid of the extra 10 per cent.”\\nThe president’s apparent willingness to make more concessions, at least for now, marks a pivot from his tariff-heavy strategy.\\nTrump insisted the deal’s strength lies in the personal rapport between top leaders – and his own intelligence.\\n\\n“I think for a long period of time, we have a smart president. We have a great relationship. If we don’t have a smart president – which is also a very strong possibility – then we won’t have a great relationship,” he said.\\nBut analysts outlined several areas of potential concern about the US-China deal, including the lack of any detailed written account of its terms.\\nWhile China has pledged to “work very hard” at stemming the flow of fentanyl ingredients, in Trump’s words, no specifics have been disclosed involving what China might do beyond what it has already.\\nThis is hugely consequential given that Beijing’s evident pledge on fentanyl is the basis for a 10 percentage point reduction in overall US tariffs on Chinese goods – to 47 per cent from 57 per cent.\\nThe deal also suspended US tariffs on Chinese imports set to hit November 1 for rare earth minerals and November 10 for “reciprocal” tariffs. Unclear, however, is how long the pause will last, whether it extends for 90 days as Trump has done repeatedly in the past, or has a longer tenure.\\nThe two sides also appeared to have a different take on what was agreed to regarding China’s rare earth export restrictions, essential for US hi-tech manufacturing of everything from food processors to military jets.\\n“Both sides are seeking to reduce their dependence on the other, and extend the other party’s dependence,” said Michael Hirson, practice head at 22V Research and a former financial attaché with the US embassy in Beijing. “This tussle is particularly intense in rare earths and semiconductors.”\\nWhile Trump said the “rare earth issue has been settled”, Beijing has focused on the pause’s one-year time frame, highlighting the continued leverage it holds over the US.\\n“It’s welcome news that Beijing agreed to hold off implementing its recently announced sweeping rare earth export restrictions, but we should expect Beijing to use this threat as a hammer over the US’ head,” said Wendy Cutler, senior vice-president at the Asia Society Policy Institute.\\n“Trump has met his match with China, which has shown that two can play at this game,” added the former deputy US trade negotiator.\\nIndeed, both sides have kept their trade ammunition handy, underscoring the lack of trust and the highly delicate nature of the truce.\\nTrump could quickly raise tariffs again if he believes China is not complying with the terms of Thursday’s deal. US Trade Representative Jamieson Greer said hours after the agreement was announced that a Section 301 investigation into China’s compliance – with provisions for additional tariffs – remains in place.\\n\\nSomewhat surprising, some analysts said, was the lack of a deal in South Korea on an “ownership transfer” of the short video platform TikTok, which had been teed up as a likely deliverable, indicating there may be more problems hammering out terms than suggested.\\nElsewhere, Trump wrote on social media that China committed to buying energy products. Yet this was not mentioned in the Chinese readouts.\\nAlso unclear was whether Trump promised Beijing it would ease export restrictions on high-end US semiconductors, a move that many in US national security circles believe would cede a key US technological advantage to America’s primary rival.\\n“His potential willingness to allow Nvidia to sell the B30A – a chip designed for China’s market and substantially more advanced than the H20 chip that Beijing has disdained – aroused a sharp reaction … in US policy circles, especially among China hawks,” Hirson said.\\n",

            "title": "Cuts to US ‘fentanyl tariffs’ help Chinese exporters close the gap on competition",
            "description": "With the US cutting its tariffs on Chinese imports by 10 per cent – halving a duty initially imposed by Washington over allegations of complicity in the fentanyl trade – analysts said the reduction may further strengthen the competitiveness of Chinese exporters, particularly in mass-produced goods.\\nFollowing a meeting on Thursday between President Xi Jinping and US President Donald Trump in South Korea, the world’s two largest economies reached a consensus on the issue, with the US agreeing to remove half of its 20 per cent in fentanyl-related tariffs on China, effective immediately.\\nThe 90-day pause on tariff increases the two sides agreed to during trade talks in May, extended by another 90 days in August, was also lengthened after this week’s meeting, this time for one year.\\nThat brings overall US tariffs on Chinese goods to 47 per cent, down from the previous 57 per cent, Trump told reporters on Air Force One after the summit. Those figures include duties imposed before Trump’s second term.\\n“The 10 per cent tariff cut on top of generally higher tariffs on the rest of the world should help improve exporters’ competitiveness to varying extents moving forward,” said Lynn Song, chief Greater China economist with Dutch financial services firm ING.\\n“Generally, China has the world’s most complete manufacturing infrastructure and benefits from economies of scale, allowing it to outcompete many other nations.”\\nDexter Roberts, a US-based senior fellow at the Global China Hub under the Atlantic Council think tank, said that Chinese exporters are already “hyper-competitive” compared with their Asian counterparts, due to the intensity of the domestic market.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nNow, with the US tariff cut, that advantage will become more evident, particularly for lower-margin products, Roberts said.\\n“Doing this on razor-thin margins is something often other countries find it hard to compete on,” he said.\\n“If they’re selling at a 10 per cent cost advantage, as soon as the fee is taken away, suddenly China becomes competitive again. For the traditional lower-value goods, the margins were extremely low,” Roberts said. “If you’re selling shoes or toys, 10 per cent is huge.”\\nThe additional duties the US imposed on China this year have been reduced to 20 per cent following the cut, narrowing or eliminating the tariff gap between China and other manufacturing hubs in Asia, including Vietnam, South Korea and Japan.\\nVietnam is currently subject to US tariffs of 20 per cent – which could be raised by an additional 40 per cent if it is found to be facilitating transshipments from China – while South Korea and Japan are each subject to 15 per cent import duties.\\nRenewed trade tensions between the US and China this year have prompted discussions among manufacturers about relocating parts of their production to Southeast Asia to mitigate the impact of trade barriers.\\nBut as the tariff landscape has changed, analysts said investors may reconsider their manufacturing arrangements, which could in turn bolster China’s exports.\\n“The commitment to postpone the pending reciprocal tariffs by one year should help improve market sentiment thanks to reduced near-term uncertainties, allowing corporates to recalibrate investment decisions and supply chain adjustments,” said Zhang Ning, senior China economist at UBS, in a research note on Friday.\\nZhang added that the tariff cut is “modestly positive for China’s export growth and global supply chain”.\\n\\n\\nMeanwhile, HSBC said in a Thursday research note that, if US tariffs are kept at current levels, this could help restore business confidence and investment.\\nThe bank estimated that China’s gross domestic product growth could be boosted by as much as 0.3 percentage points from the US tariff cut.\\nAs the world’s largest economy, the US remains China’s top single-country export destination, with an outbound shipment value of US$524.7 billion in 2024 according to Chinese customs data. This is more than three times the figure for Vietnam, the second-highest ranked country by export value.\\nHowever, Chinese exporters have been reducing their reliance on the US this year. In the first nine months of 2025, China’s exports to the US declined by 16.9 per cent year on year.\\n“The 10-percentage-point reduction is expected to have a significant positive impact on Chinese exporters and play an important role in stabilising exports to the US,” said Cui Fan, a professor of international trade at Beijing’s University of International Business and Economics, in an article posted to social media on Thursday.\\nIn his piece, Cui argued cumulative US tariffs on China now stand at around 41 per cent, rather than the 47 per cent cited by the Trump administration.\\nHe based this rate on a broad average that includes the tariffs invoked under Section 301 of the US Trade Act of 1974, as well as sector-specific tariffs imposed under Section 232 of the US Trade Expansion Act of 1962.\\n",

            "description": "The latest addition to the cast of Paramount+ hit show Tulsa King, Bella Heathcote may be a familiar face to horror fans. The Australian actress, who plays Cleo Montague in the crime drama, made her big-screen debut in the 2008 horror film Acolytes and was in Tim Burton’s 2012 horror-comedy Dark Shadows and Netflix’s 2022 horror miniseries Pieces of Her alongside Toni Collette.\\n\\nThe mob drama – created by Taylor Sheridan, whose impressive résumé includes Yellowstone and Landman – follows Sylvester Stallone as Dwight “The General” Manfredi as he sets up his own empire in Tulsa, Oklahoma, after being exiled there by his mafia boss.\\nSince Cleo entered the scene, fans have seen a new side of her old flame, Manfredi’s trusted lieutenant Mitch Keller (Garrett Hedlund).\\n\\nHere’s everything you need to know about Bella Heathcote.\\nShe began acting after her mother died\\n\\nBorn in May 1987 in Melbourne, Isabella Heathcote started taking performance classes when she was 12 at her school, Korowa Anglican Girls’ School. Her mother had died and her father, a lawyer, thought they would keep her distracted.\\nHeathcote fell in love with singing, dancing and drama, but she hesitated at first at the idea of pursuing acting as a career. It was a nudge from her father that convinced her to study drama at university.\\n“By the time I got through my first year, I realised I could only pursue acting because everything else just made me miserable,” the actress told the Herald Sun in a 2016 interview.\\nShe has a varied résumé\\n\\nFollowing her film debut in Acolytes, Heathcote starred in the long-running Australian soap opera Neighbours. She played a Berlin-born filmmaker – even leveraging her schoolgirl German and working with a dialect coach – in the Amazon Prime Video dystopian alternate-history TV series The Man in the High Castle, based on the 1962 novel by Philip K. Dick. In 2017 she portrayed Christian Grey’s mentally ill and potentially dangerous ex-girlfriend Leila in Fifty Shades Darker, the second film in the Fifty Shades franchise starring Dakota Johnson and Jamie Dornan.\\nShe collects skulls\\n\\nDuring a 2012 interview with Vogue Australia, when asked about boyfriend-worthy gift recommendations, the 38-year-old revealed that she collects skulls, adding, “I think that a beautiful skull is a really good gift for a guy”.\\nIs Bella Heathcote single?\\n\\nBad news for those crushing on the actress: Heathcote is married to architect Richard Stampton. The pair wed in 2019, according to her IMDB profile. Before Stampton, Heathcote was engaged to filmmaker Andrew Dominik, 20 years her senior. The two dated for seven years before the internet spotted Heathcote on Instagram, wearing a diamond on her ring finger to Lily Collins’ birthday party. The couple split up soon after.\\n",

            "description": "In a previous column, I outed my pre-pandemic dating life as a middle-aged newly single Chinese woman in the United Kingdom.\\nSix months into my spreadsheet approach to love (100 daily Tinder swipes, 50 culls and a literacy-and-basic-human-decency filter), however, I decamped to China – on sabbatical, to research xiaolongbao, and for the anthropological thrill of being a shengnu (leftover woman) on home turf (sort of).\\nChina greeted me with a shrug. On Tinder and Baihe in Hong Kong, Shenzhen and Shanghai, a 40-something woman doing dozens of free swipes a day netted two to three matches a week. Hong Kong said hello, then ghosted. Shenzhen tried to sell me a pyramid scheme involving hair transplants and bee pollen for men and women of all ages.\\nShanghai, though, came with a wingwoman. G, a no-nonsense East German at the conservatory where I was on research leave, pushed me into Friday tango lessons on the ninth floor of an inner-city office building that had sprung parquet flooring and was all very earnestly renovated. The Shanghainese instructor, a severe taskmistress with a bloodhound’s nose for fakes, clocked my synthetic felt-bottomed heels (I swear I was conducting fieldwork for a dance anthropology project). Everyone else refused to swap partners. I left with a sprained ankle and a compendium of stern glares.\\nSo, on to the infamous weekend marriage market at People’s Square. G, a formidable matriarch fluent in love, duty and European bakeries in Shanghai, encouraged me with a mock-imperial flourish: “Go forth in the name of anthropology, discover and conquer.”\\nThe park is a prehistoric but ruthlessly efficient analogue of Tinder, run by parents with umbrellas. Elderly Chinese mothers and fathers tape their children’s vital stats to rain gear: gender, age, height, salary, square footage of the apartment already secured in a first-tier city, in that order.\\n\\nThe market has zones and sub-zones: by decade (1970s, 1980s, 1990s), by religion (there’s a Muslim area), by education level and province. To G’s delight, there’s also a special corner for divorced men stationed overseas, including London. “Now,” G instructed, “this is your moment. You will introduce yourself to these nice parents.”\\nAnd so I did.\\nMy first mistake was to have arrived without a marriage broker. A kindly couple in their 70s waved their son’s résumé at me – sadly, no photo for quality control – and apologised for his wretched divorced status. “They broke up because she was a shinu,” a stone woman who couldn’t have children, the mother explained, lowering her voice. “And whom might you be representing?”\\n“Er…myself.”\\nSilence. Full-body scan of my dumpling-filled and dumpling-shaped physique. “When were you born? 1980s? 1970s?”\\nMore silence. Then a sympathetic cough and a pat on the shoulder. “I’m afraid you’re a little too old. Such a waste, you do have qualifications. Since you also live in the West and are obviously Western-minded, attending this day by yourself.”\\n\\nWhat? No. I was chaperoned by my wingwoman, clearly. The mother mistook my puzzlement for heartbreak and added helpfully: “Maybe you can adopt?”\\nG began to huff, affronted and protective. As if on cue, this summoned an affable actual marriage broker who had been eavesdropping. He shrugged at my plight, then brightened at G. “Your friend, the blonde, if she’s up for it, I know a guy…not quite marriageable, but definitely interested …”\\nCue evil eye and baring of teeth. We retreated to the nearest scallion pancake stall for emergency – no, incensed – consumption. That marked the end of my Shanghai dating career.\\nWhat did I learn from representing myself in a public park in a country that is both ancestral land and study site?\\nThat pre-pandemic China could be brutally ageist, patriarchal and progeny-obsessed. That the parent-run market, for all its quaintness, is more efficient than modern apps: criteria stack neatly, expectations are blatant, and romance is an optional add-on you might install later, like an artificial intelligence-powered grammar check.\\nI learned something about my own limits. I was playing scientist with my love life: swipes, filters, variables. More data equals more dates equals more happiness, no?\\n\\nBack in London, this method reaped some results. In Shanghai, the model broke on cultural rock. Without a broker, without a photo, without the correct birth decade, without the right guanxi, I wasn’t just the wrong candidate; I was a category error.\\nFriends have since reported better weather. Post-pandemic, a few Chinese aunties I know navigated new-generation apps like Tantan, dodging love scams and finding their dream uncles. The landscape shifts; the code updates.\\nBut the auntie I was in pre-pandemic Shanghai decided to quit the lab. I would focus on myself. I would do morning yoga via internet tutorials (this yielded a slipped disc and a dislocated meniscus). I would eat fewer dumplings (I ate those dumplings). I would lose 7kg (I gained 10). I would climb Huangshan in Anhui without a cable car (I went to a panda reserve in Sichuan instead and made faces at those inconveniently cute creatures).\\nI waited out my time in East Asia, between Shanghai, Singapore, Hong Kong and Shenzhen. I pressed pause on the spreadsheets. And then I returned to London to restart the experiment with a mixture of caution and mischief.\\n",

            "description": "US President Donald Trump said he received an apology from Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney over a television ad that opposed tariffs, but suggested that trade talks between the two countries would not restart.\\nAsked by reporters aboard Air Force One whether negotiations between the White House and Carney’s government would resume, Trump said: “No, but I have a very good relationship. I like him a lot, but you know, what they did was wrong. He was very nice. He apologised for what they did with the commercial.”\\nEconomic data released by Statistics Canada on Friday showed the trade battle is taking a toll on the economy, with the numbers pointing to just 0.4 per cent annualised growth in the third quarter.\\nEarlier on Friday, US Energy Secretary Chris Wright said the goal is for the US and Canada to return to the table after talks broke off last week, and for the countries to cooperate more closely on oil, gas and critical minerals.\\nThere has been friction in the talks between Canada and the US “for some good reasons”, Wright told reporters at the Group of Seven energy and environment ministers’ meeting in Toronto on Friday.\\n\\nTrump called off the negotiations last week after the province of Ontario aired an anti-tariff advertisement in the US that drew from a 1987 radio address by former US president Ronald Reagan. Trump also threatened an additional 10 per cent tariff on Canada.\\nBefore the breakdown, Carney said the two countries had been progressing on a deal on steel and aluminium sectoral tariffs, as well as energy. Carney had pitched Trump on reviving the Keystone XL pipeline project.\\n“Unfortunately we’ve had some bumps on the road,” Wright said.\\n“I would say the goal is to bring those back together and I think to see cooperation between the United States and Canada across critical minerals, across oil and gas.”\\nTrump has also said recently that he was satisfied with the current trade arrangement between the US and Canada, which includes US import taxes on cars, timber, steel and aluminium, along with a 35 per cent tariff on other goods not shipped under the US-Mexico-Canada Agreement that Trump signed during his first term.\\n",
