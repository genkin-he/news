            "title": "China’s robot makers race to roll out low-cost humanoids – but is it sustainable?",
            "description": "A wave of humanoid robot launches in China this year has shaken up the market with eye-catching low prices – though some industry insiders warn the trend might not be financially tainable and could be driven more by hype and capital than by genuine technological progress.\\nBeijing-based Noetix Robotics launched presales for its child-sized humanoid Bumi last week, selling more than 200 units at 9,998 yuan (US$1,408) each within the first three hours. Five hundred units were sold in the first two days, according to the company.\\nMarketed as the world’s first “high-performance humanoid under 10,000 yuan”, Bumi stands at 94cm (37 inches) tall, weighs about 12kg (26.5 pounds) and is seen by some as proof that affordable robots are entering the consumer market.\\nNoetix founder Jiang Zheyuan told reporters at a recent domestic media event that nearly all components were developed in-house, slashing costs. But profit margins are “indeed quite low”, he admitted to reporters.\\nThe company operates a multi-factory production system, with its Beijing facility capable of delivering over 200 units per month. A new plant in Changzhou, Jiangsu province is expected to produce 300 units per month by December, while a third facility in the works could add another 500 units per month. This would bring Noetix’s total capacity to more than 1,000 robots per month, the company said.\\nNoetix has also completed a nearly 300 million yuan (US$42.3 million) pre-B financing round to support mass production.\\nHumanoid robots have become a new battleground as major economies like China and the United States compete for global technological supremacy, with Chinese companies racing to develop cheaper, consumer-friendly models and produce them at scale.\\nBeijing-based Booster Robotics launched its Booster K1 last week – a 95cm (37.4 inches) tall humanoid weighing about 19.5 kilograms (43 pounds) – with the first batch of 100 units priced at 29,900 yuan.\\n\\n\\nIn April, Noetix’s high-performance N2 model went on sale, priced from 39,900 yuan and capable of performing backflips – a major benchmark for a unit&apos;s autonomy and dexterity. Around the same time, Shenzhen-based Engine AI launched its SA01 humanoid on e-commerce platform JD.com for 42,000 yuan.\\nUnitree Robotics also introduced its R1 in late July, priced at about 39,000 yuan – roughly 60 per cent less than its 99,000 yuan G1 model launched last year.\\nBy comparison, humanoid robots are far more costly in the US. Elon Musk has said Tesla’s robots could cost between US$20,000 and US$30,000 once full-scale production is reached, while Agility Robotics’ Digit humanoid initially sold for about US$250,000.\\nDespite the clear price advantage of certain Chinese models, many industry insiders have cast doubt on some pricing strategies.\\nHe Liang, founder of a humanoid robot maker based in Jiangsu province, said some companies were burning money to impress investors before going public.\\n“They’ve found a good niche – targeting family education and household use – which may make sense for companies trying to pave the way for IPOs,” he said. “But for us, we have to choose our battles and stay focused on real products for tourism and industrial clients.”\\nWang Lei, chairman of Shanghai Qingbao Engine Robot, said many companies were probably not making money right now. Instead, they were “scaling up, driving volume and pushing for an IPO as soon as possible”, he said.\\n“The prices are simply too low, so the gross margin is low. Once you factor in other costs, it’s questionable whether they profit at all. That’s why you can’t fight a price war in robotics – a price war would only kill yourself,” he said.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“If no one makes a profit, it will be hard to survive in the industry.”\\nHis company’s robots are priced at about 200,000 yuan, generating tens of millions of yuan in revenue this year.\\nIndustry insiders said few companies would adopt a similar low-cost strategy. “The real players are all focused on industrial applications, aiming to build billion-yuan businesses in the years ahead,” according to He.\\nNoetix did not immediately respond to the Post’s requests for comment.\\nXu Xuecheng, lead scientist at the Zhejiang Humanoid Robot Innovation Center, noted that the business-to-business market has been largely insulated from the hype, as “corporate clients have a clear understanding of the real capabilities of different robots”.\\nWith consumer-facing models still incapable of performing complex tasks for senior care or household services, it remains too early to judge whether humanoid robots have truly entered the consumer market, industry insiders said.\\nXu added that the models are “too limited in function to be considered real [consumer-facing] humanoids, yet still too expensive to be seen as toys.”\\nNoetix’s Bumi model is designed to bring emotional value by accompanying children, teaching them programming or helping them learn English, Jiang told reporters.\\nThe humanoid rental market, meanwhile, has seen a dramatic correction in recent months. The daily leasing fee for Unitree’s G1 humanoid, as high as 20,000 yuan at the beginning of the year, has plunged to about 3,000 to 4,000 yuan on some second-hand platforms.\\n",

            "title": "Nepal’s protest arson leaves a trail of burning questions: ‘it’s suspicious’",
            "description": "The fires have long since been extinguished, but in Kathmandu’s devastated government district, the embers of suspicion still smoulder.\\nNearly two months after a Gen Z-led youth uprising swept through Nepal’s capital, forensic teams are working to uncover the origins of the infernos that gutted the country’s courts and ministries, looking for signs of deliberate arson and destroyed evidence.\\n“The extent of the damage was quite shocking,” said Subash Chandra Baral, president of the Nepal Engineers’ Association, citing a preliminary damage assessment undertaken with the Department of Urban Development and Building Construction.\\n“While some sections of the Supreme Court and the Kathmandu District Court have been spared, others have been completely burned. Rooms with case files have been burned down. So you cannot help but think if this was intentional.”\\n\\nIn the Supreme Court alone, an estimated 20,000 case files – many without digital backups – were lost to the blaze, according to court spokesman Nirajan Pandey.\\nThe Kathmandu District Court suffered even heavier losses. Some 445,000 files were incinerated, along with computers and hard drives that were either looted or burned amid the unrest.\\n“It’s suspicious that the crowds would target sections with the case files while not targeting other areas in both the courts, as if they were familiar with the buildings’ layout,” Baral told This Week in Asia.\\n“There are so many questions that need to be answered through a thorough investigation.”\\n\\nBillions in damages\\nThe destruction was not confined to the capital. Nationwide, 688 government offices, 259 private homes, 128 businesses, 198 political party offices and 307 police stations were vandalised or burned during September’s protests, according to official figures.\\nInitial estimates put the cost of the damage at up to 3 trillion rupees (US$21 billion) – nearly half of Nepal’s annual gross domestic product.\\nTourism, a vital pillar of the Himalayan nation’s economy, also took a hit, with major hotels, including the Hilton and Hyatt Regency, temporarily closed due to fire damage. The Hotel Association Nepal has warned of losses of about US$175 million to the sector.\\nThe two days of violence led to the deaths of at least 76 people, including three police officers, and prompted K.P. Sharma Oli’s resignation as prime minister.\\n\\nWhile no conclusive evidence has emerged to prove the fires were deliberately set to destroy legal records, suspicions persist that some blazes may have been coordinated to destroy evidence in corruption cases.\\nInspectors say certain burn patterns suggest deliberately targeted fires.\\nPrabhu Ram Pokharel, a civil engineer who helped retrofit government buildings after a devastating earthquake hit Nepal in 2015, said a post-unrest inspection revealed unusual damage to the basement of the Kathmandu District Court.\\n“The Kathmandu District Court building looks intact from the outside, but the basement looks like it has been bombed,” he said. “There are small craters in the ceiling with light passing through them.”\\nThe Kathmandu District Court building looks intact from the outside, but the basement looks like it has been bombed\\nPrabhu Ram Pokharel, civil engineer\\nPokharel added that the use of locally sourced wooden flooring and other flammable materials in the retrofitting of some government buildings likely contributed to the rapid spread of the fires, as did a delayed firefighting response due to surrounding the chaos.\\nConflicting accounts about timelines have added to the confusion. The Nepali Army said the Supreme Court fire was extinguished a day after it began, but Chief Justice Prakash Man Singh Raut countered in a recent interview that the flames continued smouldering for three days.\\nMeanwhile, footage circulating online shows men wielding what appear to be petrol bombs outside key government buildings. Forensic experts have not ruled out the use of chemical accelerants such as sodium or magnesium, according to a New York Times report citing the Nepal Police’s Central Forensic Science Laboratory.\\n\\nA violent shift\\nLocal newspaper Kantipur also published excerpts from social media chat logs showing discussions shifting from peaceful protest to violent tactics after the police shootings of protesters on September 8, including references to corrosive petrol bombs and home-made napalm.\\nBoth the Supreme Court and Kathmandu District Court are now preparing to file formal police complaints, submitting surveillance footage and social media evidence to help police identify suspects.\\nDeputy Inspector General of Police Binod Ghimire confirmed that a team of experts had collected samples and evidence from the suspected arson sites, with more than 100 people arrested in Kathmandu alone for alleged links to the violence and property damage.\\n\\n“We can only speak based on evidence,” Ghimire said. “It’s natural to have doubts, but we need evidence to confirm if any chemicals were used to set the fires or if they were coordinated.”\\nEngineers warn that buildings structurally weakened by fire damage could pose serious risks in seismically active Nepal if not urgently repaired.\\n“The buildings have burned for days without intervention,” Baral said. “Even a small tremor could damage them more.”\\nAs prosecutors begin filing charges for arson, vandalism and looting, Nepal now faces the harder task of rebuilding public trust. The flames may be out, but the search for truth and accountability has only just begun.\\n",

            "title": "Hong Kong consumer watchdog urges caution over prepaid restaurant coupon schemes",
            "description": "Some major restaurant chains in Hong Kong are offering discounted cash coupons to attract customers in a sluggish market, but the city’s consumer watchdog has warned people to check the terms carefully and buy only what they genuinely need.\\nTai Hing, a leading casual dining group with 19 brands, launched promotions earlier this month to mark the second anniversary of its mobile app.\\nCustomers who bought HK$1,000 (US$129) worth of coupons between October 9 and 20 received 23 cash coupons valued at HK$50 each, representing an extra HK$150 in value.\\nThese coupons can be redeemed at more than 170 outlets across 13 of the group’s brands, including Men Wah Bing Teng, Teawood and Asam Chicken Rice.\\nSimilarly, fast-food giant Cafe de Coral rolled out a promotion in which customers who bought HK$400 in cash coupons – comprising 20 coupons worth HK$20 each – received an additional HK$400 in value.\\nThe bonus covered discounts on selected items and offers for free drinks and snacks during specific times of the day.\\nCustomers who bought two or three sets could also enjoy further discounts at other retailers, such as the Samsung online store and on certain Greater Bay Airlines flights. Several Cafe de Coral branches even set up booths to promote the coupon sets.\\nRetiree Chan Man spent HK$1,000 on Tai Hing coupons and received an extra HK$150 coupon for free but later regretted the decision.\\nThe 67-year-old, a regular customer at Tai Hing for breakfast, found the deal less worthwhile when he tried to use it.\\n“I thought I could use a HK$50 coupon for breakfast, which costs HK$38. But the cashier told me I will not be able to get any change by using the coupon, so I either do not use the coupon or use it without getting any change. It means I end up spending more with the restaurant,” Chan said.\\n\\nHe also tried to use a coupon for a lunch of barbecue pork with rice costing HK$78, which meant using one coupon and paying the remainder in cash.\\n“I don’t like the game of coupons; it causes me hassles,” he said, admitting he had not thought too much about the purchase when a saleslady offered it to him.\\nThe Consumer Council said that buying any product or service package amounted to a prepaid purchase, which carried certain risks.\\n“Before making a purchase, consumers should carefully consider their actual needs and carefully read the terms, such as usage restrictions and expiration dates, as well as refund and return policies,” a spokesperson said, advising customers not to overbuy simply because of promotional offers.\\nThe council added that if a merchant were to close, consumers might be unable to recover their prepaid funds.\\nIn the event of liquidation, they could only register as unsecured creditors, and if the merchant became insolvent, the chance of recovering prepaid funds would also be low.\\nThe Post contacted Tai Hing and Cafe de Coral for comment on October 23, but they had yet to respond.\\nCafe de Coral, founded in 1968, reported a nearly 30 per cent fall in net profit to HK$233 million in the last financial year compared with 2023–24. It operates 174 outlets across Hong Kong and 185 in mainland China.\\nThe city’s restaurant sector has struggled in recent years amid changing tastes among mainland visitors and a growing habit among locals of travelling across the border for leisure, leading to a wave of recent closures.\\n",

            "description": "Tanzanian President Samia Suluhu Hassan has won a landslide election victory, official results showed on Saturday, after key candidates were jailed or barred from a vote that has triggered days of violent protests.\\nThe final result showed Hassan won 97.66 per cent of the vote, dominating every constituency, the electoral commission announced on state television.\\nA quick swearing-in ceremony would take place on Saturday, state TV said.\\nAt stake for the ruling Chama Cha Mapinduzi (CCM) party was its decades-long grip on power amid the rise of charismatic opposition figures who hoped to lead the country towards political change.\\nStill, a landslide victory is unheard of in the region. Only President Paul Kagame, the authoritarian leader of Rwanda, regularly wins by a landslide.\\n\\nThe main opposition party, Chadema, says hundreds of people have been killed by security forces since protests broke out on election day on Wednesday.\\nHassan was elevated from vice-president on the sudden death of her predecessor, John Magufuli, in 2021. She has faced opposition from parts of the army and Magufuli’s allies, and sought to cement her position with an emphatic win, analysts say.\\nRights groups say she oversaw a “wave of terror” in the east African nation ahead of the vote, including a string of high-profile abductions that escalated in the final days.\\nChadema was barred from taking part in the election and its leader put on trial for treason.\\nDespite a heavy security presence, election day descended into chaos as crowds took to the streets across the country, tearing down her posters and attacking police and polling stations, leading to an internet shutdown and curfew.\\nA Chadema spokesman said on Friday that “around 700” people had been killed, based on figures gathered from a network checking hospitals and health clinics.\\nA security source and diplomat in Dar es Salaam both said that deaths were “in the hundreds”.\\n\\nHassan has not made any public statement since the unrest began.\\nHer government denies using “excessive force” but has blocked the internet and imposed a tight lockdown and curfew nationwide, making it hard to get any information.\\nNews websites have not been updated since early Wednesday and journalists are not allowed to operate freely in the country.\\nUN chief Antonio Guterres was “deeply concerned” about the situation in Tanzania, “including reports of deaths and injuries during the demonstrations”, his spokesman said in a statement on Friday.\\nMuch public anger has been directed at Hassan’s son, Abdul Halim Hafidh Ameir, accused of overseeing the crackdown.\\nThere have been unconfirmed reports of the army siding with protesters in some places, but army chief Jacob Mkunda came out strongly on Hassan’s side on Thursday, calling the protesters “criminals”.\\nForeign Minister Mahmoud Thabit Kombo said on Friday that his government had “no figures” on any dead.\\n“Currently, no excessive force has been used,” he said in an interview with Al Jazeera. “There’s no number until now of any protesters killed.”\\nThe political manoeuvring by Tanzanian authorities is remarkable even in a country where single-party rule has been the norm since the advent of multiparty politics in 1992.\\nGovernment critics point out that previous leaders tolerated opposition while maintaining a firm grip on power, whereas Hassan is accused of leading with an authoritarian style that defies youth-led democracy movements elsewhere in the region.\\nBut Tanzania is different, an outlier in the region.\\nA version of the governing CCM party, which maintains ties with the Communist Party of China, has ruled Tanzania since its independence from Britain in 1961, a streak that Hassan extends with her victory.\\nCCM is fused with the state, effectively in charge of the security apparatus and structured in such a way that new leaders emerge every five or 10 years.\\nHassan’s orderly transition after Magufuli’s death not long after the start of his second term sustained Tanzania’s reputation as an oasis of political stability and relative peace, a major reason for CCM’s considerable support across the country, especially among rural voters.\\nAdditional reporting by Associated Press\\n",

            "title": "How China’s retired teachers are helping bridge the urban-rural education divide",
            "description": "In 2021, when most of his peers were settling into retirement, 64-year-old Li Ming chose a different path. The law professor – already retired from a leading Beijing university – boarded a six-hour flight from the bustling capital to Tumxuk, a small city deep in western Xinjiang.\\nLi has remained there since, teaching multiple courses to hundreds of students at a local university as part of China’s Silver Age Teaching Programme – a sweeping state policy that mobilises a growing pool of retired urban educators to improve standards in underdeveloped regions.\\nThis year alone, Beijing plans to re-employ 7,000 retired teachers aged 65 and under to work in county towns and rural schools nationwide, according to a recent notice by the Ministry of Education and the Ministry of Finance.\\n“One of the biggest differences between urban education and rural education is the quality of the teachers,” said Scott Rozelle, the co-director of the Stanford Centre on China’s Economy and Institutions and its Rural Education Action Program.\\nAs China transitions into a high-income economy, narrowing educational disparities has become an urgent priority, he added, since human capital is an increasing driver of growth and social stability.\\n“When one looks at the share of the labour force that has been to high school, one worries that China’s human capital is not enough to keep it growing on a rapid path for the next several decades,” Rozelle said.\\nOnly about 35 per cent of China’s population had attended high school or higher in 2023, according to the country’s most recent statistical yearbook – a demographic reality underscored by the fact that one-third of its population remains rural.\\nIn contrast, OECD countries average 80 per cent, with half of that figure reaching tertiary education.\\nThese teachers already have pensions. This relieves county governments from financial strains\\nLiang Yan, Willamette University.\\nThe Silver Age Teaching Programme draws on the expertise of retired urban teachers to raise rural education standards. They assist school management by serving as vice-principals, teaching classes and mentoring local staff.\\nLi, for instance, has trained six teaching assistants in Xinjiang Uygur autonomous region over the past four years. All have been promoted to lecturers and now form a crucial part of the university staff.\\n“We senior teachers will eventually leave, but we must leave behind a team that will never leave,” he said in an interview with China Youth Daily earlier this year.\\nBut while the programme supplements the existing workforce – with tenures starting at one academic year and extensions available for strong performers – there are concerns that some localities could become too dependent on retired teachers, potentially delaying or limiting permanent recruitment, said Liang Yan, an economist at Willamette University.\\nSome schools have used the programme to fill teaching gaps caused by fluctuating enrolments. This avoids the risk of long-term permanent hires as student numbers dwindle due to demographic changes, according to a report by Xiong Bingqi, director of the Beijing-based 21st Century Education Research Institute.\\nThis has fuelled anxiety among young people, particularly recent university graduates, in an already challenging job market.\\nYouth unemployment in China has remained at worrying levels in recent years. In August, 18.9 per cent of those aged 16 to 24 – excluding students – were jobless, after a record summer graduation season.\\nThere is a clear financial incentive for localities and schools to hire older teachers.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“These teachers already have pensions,” Liang said. “This relieves county governments from financial strains.”\\nInstead of a regular salary, the programme provides an annual average stipend of 20,000 yuan for lecturers at the compulsory education level, split between the central and local governments. County governments are also responsible for providing accommodation.\\nBy contrast, hiring younger workers requires significant employer contributions to social insurance – covering pensions, housing loans and medical insurance – raising costs, especially as Beijing has started to clamp down on businesses that avoid these obligations.\\nYoung college graduates are also often reluctant to relocate to rural areas to teach, Rozelle said. While sending experienced urban teachers to rural schools helps, it only provides a temporary fix since the high turnover rate means localities must continually recruit temporary staff, he added.\\nRozelle argued that a better solution would be to encourage rural households to move to cities and enrol their children in better-resourced urban schools – something that has been very difficult to do until recently.\\n“Many third- and fourth- and fifth-tier cities are now encouraging rural people from their county to come rent or buy an apartment inside the city and send their kids to urban schools,” he said.\\nRecent urbanisation reforms have supported this by relaxing pathways for rural migrants to gain hukou – the residency permit that unlocks access to crucial public services.\\nAnyone moving to cities with fewer than 3 million residents can now qualify for local hukou after just six months of living and working there.\\n",
