            "description": "A boy tourist from China who startled a Japanese couple by squeezing into their bullet train seats to view Mount Fuji has triggered a heated discussion about manners on Japanese social media.\\nThe experience was shared by another passenger of the Tokaido Shinkansen, the bullet train that runs from Tokyo to Osaka, to the Japanese media outlet Weekly Spa!.\\nThe line offers a famous view of Mount Fuji, but the view is only available to passengers sitting on the correct side.\\n\\nThe anonymous passenger said a Chinese primary boy, who was travelling with his parents, was sitting on the wrong side.\\nAs the Mount Fuji loomed into view, the boy suddenly squeezed into the seats on the other side, where an elderly Japanese couple were seated.\\nThe wife was startled by the boy, and what shocked the couple even more was his parents looked on without apologising or disciplining their child.\\n\\nThe passenger described the boy as “plump”, which made the couple more uncomfortable.\\nHe said he saw Japanese children running around the aisles and disturbing others, but their parents did a proper job of scolding them.\\nThe boy returned to his seat but a minute later decided he had not seen enough and squeezed into the couple’s seats again.\\n\\nThis time, the elderly husband quietly retaliated by rolling down the window blinds, completely blocking the boy’s view.\\nThe boy was surprised at the man’s actions, stood still for a few seconds before giving up.\\nThe case has sparked a heated discussion online, with many supporting the elderly husband’s retaliation.\\n\\n“The man’s retaliation was quite mild because he only lowered the blinds and did not repel the rude child harshly,” one online observer said.\\nAnother person said the boy’s parents had been irresponsible.\\n“The child is what he is because of his parents. He would not irritate other people so much if the parents properly disciplined their children when they behaved badly.”\\nA third person said: “If he wanted to see Mount Fuji, he should have gone to the deck.”\\nThe post-pandemic tourism in Japan surged, as the country saw 36.9 million foreign tourists last year, surpassing the previous record of 31.9 million in 2019.\\nAs a result, discussions about overtourism and manners have risen.\\nIn 2024 and 2025, barriers were erected two times in front of a convenience shop in Fujikawaguchiko town.\\n\\nThe shop became famous among tourists as it appears to be sitting right at the foot of Mount Fuji. It attracted groups of tourists that disturbed traffic and local residents.\\nThe local government erected a barrier that allows people to take photographs while keeping them off the road.\\nIn another case, tourists in Kamakura town, an hour south of Tokyo, also drew criticism.\\nThey flowed to a railway crossing in the town, which is famously featured in Japanese animation Slam Dunk, jaywalking, littering and disturbing nearby residents.\\n",

            "description": "A Japanese atomic bomb survivors group that won the Nobel Peace Prize has strongly criticised US President Donald Trump’s surprise directive to begin nuclear weapons testing, calling it “utterly unacceptable”.\\nMore than 200,000 people were killed when the United States dropped two atomic bombs on Japan’s Hiroshima and Nagasaki during World War II, the only time nuclear weapons have been used during warfare.\\nSurvivors, known as hibakusha, have battled decades of physical and psychological trauma as well as the stigma that often came with being a victim.\\nAfter Trump said on Thursday that he had ordered the Pentagon to start nuclear weapons testing to equal China and Russia, Nobel laureate Nihon Hidankyo sent a letter of protest to the US embassy in Japan.\\nThe directive “directly contradicts the efforts by nations around the world striving for a peaceful world without nuclear weapons and is utterly unacceptable”, the survivors group said in the letter, a copy of which was obtained by Agence France-Presse on Friday.\\nThe mayor of Nagasaki also condemned Trump’s order, saying it “trampled on the efforts of people around the world who have been sweating blood and tears to realise a world without nuclear weapons”.\\n“If nuclear weapons testing were to start immediately, wouldn’t that make him unworthy of the Nobel Peace Prize?” Mayor Shiro Suzuki told reporters on Thursday, referring to Japanese Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi’s intention to nominate Trump for the award.\\n\\n\\nHidankyo, a grass roots movement of hibakusha, won the Nobel Peace Prize in 2024, and while accepting the prize, called on countries to abolish nuclear weapons.\\nTwo other atomic bomb survivor groups based in Hiroshima issued statements of protest, saying: “We strongly protest and firmly demand that no such experiments be conducted.”\\n“In a nuclear war, there are no winners or losers; all of humanity becomes the loser,” said Hiroshima Congress against A-and-H Bombs (Hiroshima Gensuikin) and the Hiroshima prefecture Federation of A-Bomb Victims Associations in a joint statement, which was also sent to the US embassy in Japan.\\n“The inhumane nature of nuclear weapons is evident from the devastation witnessed in Hiroshima and Nagasaki,” it added.\\nThe US dropped an atomic bomb on Hiroshima on August 6, 1945, and then another on Nagasaki three days later. Shortly afterwards, Japan surrendered, ending World War II.\\nAround 140,000 people died in Hiroshima and about 74,000 others in Nagasaki, including many from the effects of radiation exposure.\\nTrump’s announcement on nuclear testing left much unanswered – chiefly about whether he meant testing weapons systems or actually conducting test explosions, something the US has not done since 1992.\\nTakaichi, Japan’s first woman prime minister, this week announced she would nominate Trump for a Nobel Peace Prize as she lavished the US leader with praise during his visit to Tokyo.\\n",

It said it had agreed with Chinese anti-doping authorities who found the swimmers’ samples were contaminated.\\nThe existence of the investigation by China and Wada had been kept under wraps before the New York Times and German broadcaster ARD reported on it last year.\\nARD reported on Wednesday that the agency was looking for the person who tipped off the news media about the investigation.

            "description": "A million-dollar gold heist in Thailand’s far south by armed robbers who blocked roads with spikes and set explosives to seal their escape across the Malaysian border has rattled the Thai security establishment, as efforts to reignite peace talks in an area roiled by insurgency continue to fall flat.\\nAround 20 men working in three teams carried out the October 5 theft from a gold shop in Sungai Kolok, bordering Malaysia’s Kelantan State.\\nThe theft of hundreds of gold ornaments and jewellery valued at 35 million baht (US$1.08 million) came as prices for the precious metal spiked to historic highs of over US$4,200 per 28 grams (one ounce) earlier this month.\\nUsing two stolen getaway trucks, the robbers planted road spikes and explosives to obstruct police pursuit in a heist so well oiled that Thai authorities immediately attributed it to the Barisan Revolusi Nasional Melayu Patani (BRN).\\n\\nTwo days after the hold-up, Defence Minister Nattaphon Narkphanit said the alleged BRN operatives had already smuggled the gold out of Thailand and that efforts to recover it would require “cross-border cooperation”, without naming Malaysia specifically.\\nThe BRN is the primary separatist movement controlling combatants in Thailand’s Malay-Muslim majority south.\\nA shadowy, underground movement, the BRN has led the rebellion against control by Bangkok. It accuses the Thai state of widespread abuses and of railroading the south’s unique Malay culture as well as trying to tip the demographic balance away from the Muslim population by moving in Buddhist settlers from the poor northeast of the country.\\nThe BRN typically neither confirms nor denies involvement in violent or criminal incidents, but its cells have in the past been accused of targeting civilians.\\nViolence as resistance\\nThe gold heist follows a spike in violence this year, including 88 deaths linked to the rebellion, according to conflict monitor Deep South Watch.\\n“The violence is a form of resistance; even the recent gold heist needs to be understood in those terms,” Asmadee Bueraheng, a Pattani-based writer and long-time conflict observer, told This Week in Asia.\\n“BRN combatants are protesting the Thai economic system, which they see as unfair, the policy of assimilation, which Malay Muslims reject because it comes at the expense of their religious identity, and the government’s transmigration policy, which they see as outside settlers occupying and taking away their land.”\\nAn insurgency has blistered across Thailand’s southernmost provinces for over two decades, claiming more than 7,700 lives. Many of those killed were civilians caught in shootings and bomb attacks by rebels as well as assaults by Thai forces.\\nThe BRN has been engaging in on-again, off-again peace talks to the Thai government since 2013. Mediated by Malaysia, the discussions have sputtered. Successive Thai governments have shown little political will to resolve the conflict as concessions to the Malays of Patani are deemed costly politically.\\n\\nAfter decades of grinding stalemate, the BRN’s current leadership has shown a willingness to compromise. Three years ago, the group agreed to negotiate under the terms of the Thai constitution, which explicitly states the country is “inseparable”. This apparent softening of its stance for a separate state makes it easier for talks to take place.\\n“Ultimately, we aim to establish a power-sharing system that guarantees justice, autonomy and recognition of Patani’s distinct identity,” the spokesman for the BRN’s negotiation team, Nikmatulla bin Seri said, using the Malay spelling for the kingdom colonised by Thailand over a century ago.\\nBut talks are often undercut by violence that, once unleashed, takes on a dynamic of its own.\\nIn April, Thai security forces killed senior BRN member Abdulroning Lateh, a battle-hardened 60-year-old who helped nurture the current generation of combatants that resurfaced in January 2004. In response, his followers hit civilian and military targets, culminating in the May 2 killing of four civilians, including a nine-year-old girl and a 76-year-old blind woman in Narathiwat province.\\nThe violence also threatens to spill outside the confines of the south. On June 11, improvised explosive devices were found in Krabi and Phuket – two of Thailand’s top tourist destinations. Their locations were revealed by two suspected BRN operatives who confessed to planting them after they were caught.\\nInstability in Bangkok\\nThe lack of concrete progress on peace has been made worse by chronic instability in Bangkok, which has had three prime ministers in as many years. A potential election early next year is set to bring yet another government.\\nAfter the fall of successive Thai governments under Thaksin Shinawatra’s Pheu Thai party, hopes for peace talks to résumé and a political deal to the conflict have receded.\\nThe new short-term government of Prime Minister Anutin Charnvirakul has appointed a new chief negotiator for the deep south process, despite his government’s curtailed four-month tenure.\\nRetired general Somsak Rungsita, a former secretary general of the National Security Council, will lead the Malaysia-mediated talks.\\n\\n\\nHis task is urgent. If peace cannot be struck soon, future BRN leaders may be less accommodating, warns Artef Sokho of The Patani, a peace advocacy group which sometimes acts as a go-between with the rebels and the Thai side.\\n“BRN elders command a great deal of respect from their people,” he said. “Right now, they are willing to negotiate for a fair deal. But if and when these ageing leaders step down or pass away, I’m not so sure the next generation of leaders will be as accommodating.”\\nThai security chiefs have raised the prospect of reintroducing an emergency decree on swathes of the restive south, where it had been lifted as a confidence-building measure. Most of the region remains smothered under martial law and an emergency decree, permitting 30-day detentions without legal representation, which civil society groups say allows the state to round up civilians – including political activists – without charge or cause.\\nUntil those draconian powers are dropped, it will be impossible to negotiate, irrespective of who leads the Bangkok administration, conflict monitors warn.\\n“Setting up a team for the peace talks, along with bringing in an outsider to command over this region, is meaningless because these controversial laws and harassments are still in place,” Asmadee said.\\n",

            "description": "Wearing large rubber boots, Nadine Mitschunas joyfully handled mature rice plants peeking through the water of her small plot growing in the fertile soil of eastern England.\\nGrowing rice “has not been done before in the UK”, said Mitschunas, a field ecologist at the UK Centre for Ecology &amp; Hydrology (UKCEH).\\nBut as temperatures warm due to climate change, “it’s not such a crazy idea because it seems to work”, she added.\\nAs rice grows in eastern England, lemon groves and chickpeas were also cropping up in the south.\\nA warmer climate and changing rainfall patterns have made planning ahead essential, and British researchers are embarking on a journey of agricultural transformation.\\n\\nMitschunas is leading research with a project that tests new crops in the flat Fens of Cambridgeshire by rewetting peatlands.\\nIts rich soil has facilitated high production levels, and the region now cultivates one third of England’s vegetables and 20 per cent of its potatoes and beetroots.\\nBut soil drainage gradually impoverishes the land, posing a threat to local farmers and releasing the CO2 captured by the peatland which are important carbon sinks.\\nCraig and Sarah-Jane Taylor, the landowners participating in the UKCEH scheme, were conscious of the issue.\\n“We recognise that our soils are depleting and that we need to change to secure the future,” said Sarah-Jane Taylor, underlining the question of “water availability... and that’s only going to get worse”.\\nThe United Kingdom, like the rest of the world, has been affected by climate change. It now has to contend with more frequent extreme weather, rising temperatures, and drier soil in some areas.\\n\\nA recent UKCEH study suggested that the growth of popular crops such as wheat and strawberries would become much more difficult over the coming decades if the climate warmed by 2 degrees Celsius. If temperatures rise by 4 degrees, onion and oat crops would be hit.\\nOn the other hand, crops such as sunflower, durum wheat, soybean, chickpeas, lemon and okra could become more viable, particularly in southwestern England or near the Scottish coast.\\nChina and India are the world’s leading producers of rice.\\nAnd in the Fens, Mitschunas has tested nine rice varieties regularly grown in the United States, the Philippines, Macedonia and Japan - four of them show promise, particularly one that originates from Colombia.\\nOnce the grains germinated in a laboratory, the seedlings were planted in water in June, and harvesting began in early October.\\n“I am not eating my own rice yet,” the ecologist joked. But such a scenario could become a reality within 10 years.\\n“The suitable climate for rice is moving more northwards” in Europe, she said, pointing to successful initiatives in the Netherlands and Germany.\\nMitschunas is also testing everything from lettuce and celery to pumpkins and strawberries - and even aromatic plants.\\nAlong with crop experimentation, her project aims to regenerate peatlands and improve the country’s CO2-capturing capacities.\\nShe is not the only British researcher testing new crops.\\nAt the University of Southampton in southern England, professor of biological sciences Mark Chapman is leading a study on different crops, including chickpea cultivation.\\n“If we wait until 20 or 30 years, and then realise that we can’t grow wheat... like we always have done, we’ve then got (a) problem,” he said.\\nHe emphasised the need to “smooth the transition” by prioritising which future crops to grow and ensuring consumers are ready to change their habits.\\n“I think we’re at that point where we just need to try more things,” he said. “We need to get farmers involved, who are actually going to plant the crops.”\\nThe pioneers in the Fens, Sarah-Jane and Craig Taylor, have noted other farmers’ growing interest in the project following their initial surprise.\\n“Once upon a time potatoes and sugar beet weren’t grown here and now they’re one of the main crops in the area,” said Sarah-Jane Taylor.\\n“So why couldn’t rice potentially be an option here? And why shouldn’t we look at it?”\\n",

            "description": "A mega waterfront commercial site in Hong Kong’s Quarry Bay that has been left idle for nearly two decades by a now-bankrupt local businessman may finally be poised for a revival.\\nThe current owner, Marine Riches, majority owned by South Korean private equity group MBK Partners, had applied to amend plans for the site to the Town Planning Board – a move that came amid signs of recovery in Hong Kong’s retail sector and property market.\\nMarine Riches proposed to build a mixed-use development focusing on culture and tourism alongside a residential project, according to the minutes of a meeting released by the Harbourfront Commission on Friday. The meeting was aimed at seeking views of commission members on a section 12A application, which is used to propose changes to land use.\\nThe seafront site, comprising two plots totalling 91,838 sq ft on Hoi Yu Street, has undergone multiple planning revisions since the early 2000s. The plots were acquired for HK$1 billion (US$128 million) in June 2024, according to Land Registry records.\\n\\nThe plots were originally approved as industrial lots in 2001, with the first landlord, Fine Tower Associates – an entity connected to Pacific Concord Holdings – securing approval to construct a 25-storey industrial building, according to official records.\\nBusinessman Wong Sai-chung was the chairman of Pacific Concord, a Hong Kong-listed company from 1987 to 2003, and the managing director of the now-liquidated property developer China Properties Group, which delisted from the Hong Kong stock exchange in 2023.\\nFine Tower envisioned constructing an “Old Hong Kong” theme park – featuring replicas of historic architecture from Central, Wan Chai and Happy Valley – after learning that the site could be rezoned from industrial use to cultural, leisure and tourism uses. Its application submitted to the Town Planning Board was turned down in September 2003, according to the Post’s previous reporting.\\nFollowing the setback, the site remained idle for years, used only as temporary car parks.\\nIn 2017, Fine Tower began foundation work for the development of an industrial building but public pressure mounted to repurpose the site in line with a harbourfront boardwalk vision.\\nIn 2021, the Chief Executive in Council approved an in-situ land exchange to allow for a new development comprising one office block and four hotel blocks with a total of 400 rooms on top of a two-storey retail podium. Fine Tower, however, was already facing financial difficulties before the exchange was completed.\\nThe site was valued at HK$4 billion when it was put up for tender by creditors in 2022. Marine Riches purchased the plots in June 2024.\\nUnder the new amendment application, more than half of the total cultural, leisure and tourism spaces would be dedicated to a large-scale, privately owned immersive exhibition venue in Hong Kong. Marine Riches said it had secured a content partnership deal with Neon Global, a creator of immersive shows featuring popular intellectual properties – like Harry Potter, Marvel Avengers and Jurassic World – in Asia and across the world.\\nUpon completion, the development was expected to attract around 5,000 visitors daily, on par with the Hong Kong Palace Museum and the M+ Museum, the application said.\\n\\nThe project would integrate residential, retail and dining spaces – creating a new hub for residents and visitors – and directly supported the city’s priorities to boost tourism, expand cultural infrastructure, foster creative industries and provide quality housing and public space, according to the application.\\nThe application coincides with a rebound in Hong Kong’s retail sales, which saw a 3.8 per cent year-on-year increase in August, marking the fourth consecutive month of growth, aided by the city’s mega-event tourism drive.\\nThe city’s residential property market also showed signs of improvement, with lived-in home prices rising 1.3 per cent in September, their biggest gains so far this year. The city’s rental prices, at the same time, inched within a hair of their historical peak, according to data from the Rating and Valuation Department.\\nMarine Riches would also be partnering with a local developer, according to a source familiar with the matter. It was too early to disclose a construction timeline, the source added.\\nMBK did not respond to a request for comment.\\nMBK, founded in 2005 and focusing on investment in North Asia, had over US$30 billion in assets under management, according to its website. Among its notable deals was a buyout of Universal Studios Japan, one of Asia’s largest theme parks, for US$1.4 billion in 2009. It sold all of its stakes to Comcast NBCUniversal in 2017, according to media reports.\\nIt also bought five maritime theme parks in mainland China from Hong Kong-listed hospitality group Haichang Ocean Park Holdings for 6.05 billion yuan (US$843 million) in 2021.\\n",
