            "description": "Just three hours after lift-off, a trio of Chinese astronauts – and four mice – have arrived at the Tiangong space station for China’s first in-orbit mammal study.\\nThe Shenzhou-21 crew was launched aboard a Long March-2F rocket from the Jiuquan Satellite Launch Centre in the Gobi Desert at 11.44pm Beijing time on Friday, according to the China Manned Space Agency.\\nAbout 10 minutes into the flight, the spacecraft separated from the rocket and entered its planned orbit with high precision. The astronauts were reported to be in good condition, and the launch was declared a success.\\nAt 3.22am on Saturday, the spacecraft docked with the forward port of the T-shaped Tiangong, orbiting about 390km (242 miles) above Earth. The rendezvous and docking took roughly three and a half hours, “setting a new record for the fastest flight and docking between a Shenzhou spacecraft and the space station”, the agency said.\\nUpon entering Tiangong around 5am, commander Zhang Lu, flight engineer Wu Fei, and payload specialist Zhang Hongzhang were greeted by their Shenzhou-20 colleagues, who have been living and working on the station since April.\\n\\n\\nDuring their six-month stay, the crew will install protective devices to shield the space station from space debris, test new spacesuits and conduct 27 scientific experiments focused on biotechnology, materials science, microgravity physics and advanced space technologies.\\nThe rodent experiment, which involves two male and two female lab mice, will be carried out while both crews are aboard Tiangong. The astronauts will monitor how weightlessness, confinement and radiation affect the animals’ physiology and behaviour. The research is expected to provide insights for future long-duration human space flight.\\nThe mice will return to Earth with the Shenzhou-20 crew in about five days, according to state broadcaster CCTV.\\nAmong the Shenzhou-21 crew, commander Zhang Lu flew on Shenzhou-15 three years ago, while 32-year-old Wu, from the China Academy of Space Technology, is the country’s youngest astronaut to be sent to space.\\nZhang Hongzhang, a researcher at the Chinese Academy of Sciences, specialises in vanadium flow batteries – large, rechargeable energy storage systems used mainly for storing electricity from renewable sources such as solar and wind.\\nThe Shenzhou-21 mission marks China’s 10th crewed flight to Tiangong since June 2021. China is also training two Pakistani astronauts, one of whom is expected to join a future short-term mission to Tiangong under a bilateral space cooperation agreement signed earlier this year.\\nTiangong, designed to operate for at least a decade, represents China’s ambition to maintain a long-term human presence in low Earth orbit.\\nMeanwhile, the International Space Station (ISS), built by a Nasa-led partnership, is marking 25 years of continuous human occupancy this weekend. The ISS partners plan to continue operations until 2030, after which Nasa and SpaceX are expected to guide the station into a controlled re-entry over the South Pacific Ocean, in a remote region known as Point Nemo.\\n",

            "description": "When Grace Oh began experiencing perimenopause symptoms around the age of 45, including sleep difficulties and low energy, a well-known gynaecologist in Singapore dismissed them, saying, “You can’t be in perimenopause – your periods are still regular.”\\nThe information was wrong.\\nOther doctors told her that “menopause is a normal part of ageing, not a disease”, leaving little space for a deeper discussion about her physical and emotional changes.\\n“These encounters – at different points in my life – revealed a consistent pattern: many doctors lack the framework, language or confidence to address menopause holistically.”\\nLeft with more questions than answers, South Korean Oh began sharing evidence-based information online. This initiative sowed the seeds for a career pivot that would see the graduate of Dartmouth College and Harvard Business School leave a successful Wall Street career to pursue the under-researched menopause care market.\\n“There has been very little research on women’s health beyond fertility, and many women have been dismissed or misdiagnosed,” Oh says.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nView this post on Instagram\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nA post shared by SOL | Menopause app for women in Asia (@solmenopause)\\n\\n\\n\\nWhat she learned was that many women are misunderstood. Some doctors dismissed symptoms, telling women to “do some yoga” or that they are “too young to be experiencing menopause symptoms”. Others gaslight women by saying their symptoms were “in their head”.\\nA big problem, Oh says, is a lack of research involving Asian women, which, in turn, affects diagnosis and treatment.\\nStudies have shown that significant racial and ethnic disparities exist in the age of menopause onset, the duration of the menopausal transition, and the frequency and severity of symptoms.\\nResearch shows that Asian women often experience menopause earlier, at ages 48-49, compared to 51 for Caucasian women, with South Asians experiencing it even earlier.\\nSymptoms vary: in Caucasian women, hot flushes are the most common symptom, while Asian women are more likely to experience joint and muscle pain.\\n“Doctors were dismissing women because they didn’t have enough training and were following information that they were taught 20 years ago, based on research conducted on Caucasian women in the US and UK,” Oh says, adding it is an example of the medical bias that exists in women’s health. “The median percentage of Asian participants per biomedical study is only 3.8 per cent.”\\nLast month, Oh saw the fruition of years of work on the subject with the launch of Sol Menopause, a medically reviewed menopause app that gives women access to trusted guidance while providing employers with a solution to improve well-being and retention.\\n\\nDeveloped with healthcare professionals and informed by experience, created specifically for women in Asia, Sol – for Spring of Life – delivers personalised and culturally relevant support.\\nIt is timely. The financial and productivity consequences of menopause are linked to an estimated US$150 billion in annual costs worldwide, driven by lost productivity and healthcare expenses.\\nWorldwide, 1.2 billion women over the age of 45 represent almost one-third of the female population, yet 80 per cent of doctors receive little or no training in menopause, Oh says.\\nIn Asia-Pacific, where cultural stigma remains strong, Oh says, 67 per cent of women over 45 say symptoms disrupt their work, leading to talent loss at senior levels.\\nSol is a tool that can be used daily and discreetly, she says.\\nTashiya Mirando, family doctor and menopause lead at Singapore’s Osler Health International and medical adviser to Sol, says the app aims to empower women.\\n\\n“Too many women navigate menopause feeling dismissed and without reliable support. Sol directly addresses this by providing trusted, medically reviewed information and personalised tools,” Mirando says.\\n“This isn’t just about improving health outcomes; it’s about empowering women to thrive in every aspect of their lives, including the workplace.”\\nAvailable on iOS, Sol offers tools and resources, including confidential, evidence-based guidance and symptom tracking, personalised wellness plans and bite-sized programmes to support sustainable behaviour change.\\nIt also provides a practitioner map that connects users to trusted doctors and specialists across the region.\\nFor organisations, Sol offers practical frameworks to build menopause-inclusive workplace policies and fosters a supportive community for employees navigating this life stage.\\nThe app, Oh says, is useful for people who have already gone through perimenopause and is more than a symptom tracker.\\n“It is also a longevity companion that gives you tools, information and support to take charge of your whole health – cardiovascular, mental, cognitive, sexual, pelvic, musculoskeletal or metabolic – even after you no longer experience perimenopause symptoms,” Oh says.\\n\\n“There are in-depth expert series, [a] personalised health report and wellness blueprint, and community features including a professional map to support women holistically through different life stages.”\\nSol Menopause is another example of the burgeoning “femtech” sector, a sphere devoted to technological solutions for health conditions specific to women, from maternal, menstrual and menopause to sexual health and fertility.\\nBut while there is much hype around the sector – it is estimated to reach US$60 billion globally by 2027 – Oh says there is a long way to go, with gender bias in funding a major obstacle.\\n“I would say the femtech industry is emerging, not established,” Oh says. Industry players need collaboration and support because investors are looking for returns, but these are still unproven.\\nThe app is also a huge personal milestone for Oh. It is a product of her passion and something that she has done for herself. In the past, she says, she made decisions to make others happy.\\n\\n\\nFor years, she felt pressure from her parents, teachers and society to follow a prestigious path that was expected from “a nice girl”. Oh’s led her to New York’s Juilliard to study the violin, where she would sometimes practise up to 18 hours a day.\\nLater came the pressure to be flexible and accommodate her husband’s career, often at the expense of her own opportunities.\\n“A lot of people had a say in my life, but now I’m on my path and helping women navigate midlife changes and improve their health and well-being,” Oh says.\\nOh is keen to have continuous feedback and improvement to make the app more effective and user-friendly, to continue to conduct and source more research, and explore ways to raise awareness.\\n“I want people to have stigma-free conversations about menopause … I want to build a supportive community.”\\nLike what you read?

            "description": "Chinese President Xi Jinping and South Korean President Lee Jae-myung held talks on Saturday, discussing ways to advance practical cooperation between the two countries and the progress on the denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula.\\nThey met on the sidelines of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (Apec) summit in Gyeongju, South Korea.\\nIt was the first one-on-one meeting between Xi and Lee since the latter assumed office in June. The meeting took place at Gyeongju National Museum, the same venue where Lee and US President Donald Trump held a summit on Wednesday.\\nThis is Xi’s first state visit to South Korea since 2014.\\nLee has positioned himself as a centrist aiming to redefine South Korea’s diplomacy.\\nHe has pledged a “pragmatic” foreign policy that prioritises South Korea’s crucial military alliance with the United States, which Seoul relies on for military security to deter North Korea, while carefully managing relations with China and Russia.\\nChina has been South Korea’s biggest trading partner for two decades. In 2022, China accounted for the largest share of South Korea’s exports and imports, while South Korea became China’s second-biggest trading partner.\\nIn a friendly gesture, Lee said that while ties between Seoul and Beijing had “not completely recovered yet”, pragmatic relations were necessary.\\n“Although there may be small hindrances along the way, we will surely overcome these obstacles for better changes and bigger benefits for the governments of Korea and China,” Lee said at a press conference after the conclusion of the Apec summit on Saturday and before his summit with Xi.\\nLee also noted China’s “important role” in the stability of the Korean peninsula and said he looked forward to seeing Beijing play a bigger role.\\nHe added that Seoul would continue taking pre-emptive measures to ease military tension and build trust with North Korea to promote peace on the peninsula.\\nBut hours earlier, Pyongyang said denuclearisation was a “pipe dream” that could never be realised, according to the Korean Central News Agency (KCNA).\\n\\nIn an interview with China’s state-run Xinhua news agency published on Wednesday, Lee called for “friendly competition and cooperation on an equal footing” between Beijing and Seoul. He noted that competition between the two countries had risen due to China’s growing industrial competitiveness and hi-tech capabilities.\\nThe meeting between Xi and Lee faced an early challenge after Washington approved Seoul’s pursuit of nuclear-powered submarines, a decision announced after the summit between Lee and Trump on Wednesday.\\nThis move was widely seen as a joint effort to strengthen Seoul’s naval capabilities – not just against threats from Pyongyang, but also as a counterbalance to Beijing. It also highlighted Seoul’s growing alignment with Washington’s Indo-Pacific strategy to contain China.\\nIn a recent interview with Time magazine marking his first 100 days in office, Lee acknowledged the complexities of navigating between the US and China.\\n“We will stand alongside the US in the emerging global order and in supply chains centred around the US, but it is crucial for us to manage our relationship with China carefully to avoid antagonising them,” he said.\\nLee has asserted that South Korea’s traditional strategy of depending on the US for security and China for economic growth was no longer viable in the face of shifting global dynamics.\\nLee’s administration has sought to avoid entangling South Korea in contentious issues such as Taiwan. When asked in the Time interview whether South Korea would come to Taiwan’s aid in the event of an attack by Beijing, Lee sidestepped the question, saying he would answer when “aliens are about to invade the Earth”.\\nBeijing sees Taiwan as a part of China to be reunited by force, if necessary. Most countries, including the United States, do not recognise Taiwan as independent, but Washington is opposed to any attempt to take the island by force and is committed to arming it for its defence.\\n",

            "title": "To Trump, Asean and Apec are simply platforms for his own agenda",
            "description": "Political leaders like to perform on the global stage and there is no greater “performer” in this regard than US President Donald Trump, who has just been swinging across Asia, doing deals while posing as the best buddy of every national leader he met.\\nThat kind of showmanship may impress people at home and possibly win more political support, but it hijacks the need for genuine diplomacy and international cooperation in both an economic and political sense.\\nTwo cases in point are the most recent summits of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (Asean) in Malaysia and the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (Apec) forum in South Korea. These organisations and the meetings they hold are supposed to be concerned primarily with regional cooperation and integration. Instead, they became platforms for great power politics.\\nSuch gatherings, ostensibly meant to prioritise matters of common interest, are ultimately eclipsed when they become the setting for leaders seeking to resolve bilateral disputes between nations that are not even members of the group in some cases.\\nTrump, for example, stole the limelight at the Apec summit through his meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping. He also effectively claimed credit for a ceasefire between Thailand and Cambodia during his attendance at the Asean summit. Similarly, his meeting with new Japanese Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi, heralding a new “golden age” of bilateral ties, hogged the headlines between the Asean and Apec meetings.\\nThere are issues of critical importance, such as the impact of US tariffs on regional trade, inflated asset prices which threaten a financial crisis, rapidly ageing populations, the so-called middle-income trap and climate change, among other issues, which members of both regional organisations must contend with during summits.\\n\\nHowever, all the hard work undertaken by politicians and bureaucrats in individual Asean or Apec nations in preparation for the summits ends up being overshadowed by the posturing of great powers. Trump’s tariff tantrums have done this to a perhaps unprecedented extent.\\nTrump is undoubtedly skilled in generating publicity around the “art of the deal”, a personal manifesto of the American president, inspired by his book of the same name. He imposes penalties, whether tariffs or sanctions, on other countries and then declares victory by partially rolling them back in return for favours from the countries he is targeting.\\nAs economist Richard Katz observed during a recent panel discussion in Tokyo, Trump scares nations by threatening to amputate both legs – and then only cuts off one.\\nThe implied message in this kind of behaviour is that bullying pays off, that “might is right”, whereas Asian leaders ought to instead condemn US protectionism under Trump while focusing on reinforcing their own regional solidarity and the need to reduce economic dependence on the United States.\\nThere was a relative paucity of economic substance at both the Asean and Apec meetings and even moments of progress were cast into the shadows by the blaze of publicity given to great-power posturing by the leaders and diplomats who attended, notably Trump. While Xi didn’t make it to Kuala Lumpur, he has been a prominent presence in Gyeongju. Moreover, a Russian delegation was present at both summits.\\n\\nAs respective hosts of the two international gatherings, Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim and South Korean President Lee Jae-myung also added to the star line-up at the events and arguably helped distract attention from the business emphasis needed as their countries face economic challenges of one kind or another.\\nIt may be coincidental that these exchanges among great powers took place on the so-called “sidelines” of the Asean and Apec meetings, but this is highly unlikely. The fact is that they provide organisational infrastructure, largely paid for by the host nations, while also providing diplomatic cover for semi-official encounters.\\nThey do not involve formal agreements or treaty obligations between leaders, which are necessary for true and lasting cooperation. By piggybacking on meetings of regional organisations, the leaders of great powers are able to freely make promises in ways that do not match commitments made within the institutional framework of Asean, Apec or other such groupings.\\n\\nTop-down summit diplomacy has its place, of course, but it should not be conducted at the expense of regional business. If Trump wants to gain popularity beyond the borders of the US, he should ensure that his foreign policy does not interfere with or overshadow the routine business of regional organisations, for which he displays only minimal respect at best.\\nThe same criticism might be levelled against political leaders of other great powers such as China and Japan. However, their international agenda is set to some extent by the timing of Trump’s appearance at key summits. They may well feel duty bound to turn up at the same time to preserve credibility or “save face”.\\nLeaders of great powers should not be allowed to turn their backs on globalisation and multilateralism on one hand, while using global or regional multilateral organisations as platforms to attract attention to their own interests and agendas on the other. They should either commit entirely to international cooperation or cease using what remains of it to suit their own ends.\\n",
