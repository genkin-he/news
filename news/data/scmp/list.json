Maheswra Reddy said.\\nOn this day, the devotees fast and offer prayers to Lord Vishnu, a key Hindu deity.\\nAn initial investigation suggests that an iron grille meant to maintain the queue of worshippers at the temple broke, leading to the uncontrolled crowd surge, Reddy said.\\nSenior local government official Swapnil Dinkar Pundkar said more casualties were feared. “Initially, we had reports of seven deaths, but two more people have succumbed to their injuries while the condition of one other is critical,” he said.\\nVideo footage on local media showed people rushing to help those who fainted in the crowd surge and were gasping for breath. Some were seen rubbing the hands of those who fell on the ground.\\nN.

            "title": "China’s Xi and South Korea’s Lee discuss practical cooperation, denuclearisation progress",
            "description": "Chinese President Xi Jinping and South Korean President Lee Jae-myung held talks on Saturday, discussing ways to advance practical cooperation between the two countries and the progress on the denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula.\\nThey met on the sidelines of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (Apec) summit in Gyeongju, South Korea.\\nIt was the first one-on-one meeting between Xi and Lee since the latter assumed office in June. The meeting took place at Gyeongju National Museum, the same venue where Lee and US President Donald Trump held a summit on Wednesday.\\nThis is Xi’s first state visit to South Korea since 2014.\\nLee has positioned himself as a centrist aiming to redefine South Korea’s diplomacy.\\nHe has pledged a “pragmatic” foreign policy that prioritises South Korea’s crucial military alliance with the United States, which Seoul relies on for military security to deter North Korea, while carefully managing relations with China and Russia.\\nChina has been South Korea’s biggest trading partner for two decades. In 2022, China accounted for the largest share of South Korea’s exports and imports, while South Korea became China’s second-biggest trading partner.\\nIn a friendly gesture, Lee said that while ties between Seoul and Beijing had “not completely recovered yet”, pragmatic relations were necessary.\\n“Although there may be small hindrances along the way, we will surely overcome these obstacles for better changes and bigger benefits for the governments of Korea and China,” Lee said at a press conference after the conclusion of the Apec summit on Saturday and before his summit with Xi.\\nLee also noted China’s “important role” in the stability of the Korean peninsula and said he looked forward to seeing Beijing play a bigger role.\\nHe added that Seoul would continue taking pre-emptive measures to ease military tension and build trust with North Korea to promote peace on the peninsula.\\nBut hours earlier, Pyongyang said denuclearisation was a “pipe dream” that could never be realised, according to the Korean Central News Agency (KCNA).\\n\\nIn an interview with China’s state-run Xinhua news agency published on Wednesday, Lee called for “friendly competition and cooperation on an equal footing” between Beijing and Seoul. He noted that competition between the two countries had risen due to China’s growing industrial competitiveness and hi-tech capabilities.\\nThe meeting between Xi and Lee faced an early challenge after Washington approved Seoul’s pursuit of nuclear-powered submarines, a decision announced after the summit between Lee and Trump on Wednesday.\\nThis move was widely seen as a joint effort to strengthen Seoul’s naval capabilities – not just against threats from Pyongyang, but also as a counterbalance to Beijing. It also highlighted Seoul’s growing alignment with Washington’s Indo-Pacific strategy to contain China.\\nIn a recent interview with Time magazine marking his first 100 days in office, Lee acknowledged the complexities of navigating between the US and China.\\n“We will stand alongside the US in the emerging global order and in supply chains centred around the US, but it is crucial for us to manage our relationship with China carefully to avoid antagonising them,” he said.\\nLee has asserted that South Korea’s traditional strategy of depending on the US for security and China for economic growth was no longer viable in the face of shifting global dynamics.\\nLee’s administration has sought to avoid entangling South Korea in contentious issues such as Taiwan. When asked in the Time interview whether South Korea would come to Taiwan’s aid in the event of an attack by Beijing, Lee sidestepped the question, saying he would answer when “aliens are about to invade the Earth”.\\nBeijing sees Taiwan as a part of China to be reunited by force, if necessary. Most countries, including the United States, do not recognise Taiwan as independent, but Washington is opposed to any attempt to take the island by force and is committed to arming it for its defence.\\n",

            "description": "Belle Kwok Sin-ming, 33, felt a calling to take on the role of a Hong Kong auxiliary police constable even while working her day job as an engineer at the Electrical and Mechanical Services Department.\\n“At work, I am responsible for planning and managing projects related to the police force, including the electronic system of their training facilities,” Kwok said.\\n“I could feel their professionalism in the constant contact with them, which piqued my interest in their work.”\\nShe added that she applied for the job at her mother’s encouragement, who was herself an auxiliary police constable in the past.\\n“Growing up, she used to share stories of her experiences with me, and now I would tell her mine.”\\nKwok is one of 72 auxiliary police constables graduating on Saturday, after completing a 370-hour training spread across 26 to 33 weeks, covering areas such as law, police practices and Chinese foot drills as well as weapons handling and tactics.\\n\\nAccording to police, the auxiliary force could be tasked with jobs involving internal security, crowd management at major events, daily beat patrols, technology crime support, traffic team cadre, report room and others.\\nThe pay for each member of the 3,439-strong auxiliary starts from HK$115 (US$14.80) per hour or HK$920 per day, and could go up to HK$359 per hour or HK$2,872 per day, depending on their rank.\\nKwok hoped that the experience gained from her respective jobs could complement each other, allowing her to provide practical suggestions as a user in engineering projects for the force and to explore how police work could be made safer and more efficient with technology.\\nShe said she planned to use most of her weekends to fulfil the requirement of working at least 208 hours a year as an auxiliary police constable, and that she could balance the work with her main job as an engineer with good planning.\\nPatrick Sin Ka-ho, a fellow auxiliary police constable graduating on Saturday, is an assistant headmaster at a secondary school in Hong Kong. The 35-year-old teaches history, geography as well as citizenship and social development.\\nWhile the roles of a police officer and a teacher might seem miles apart from each other, they share a common goal of educating, Sin said.\\n\\nHe added that the skills acquired in his police role could help better protect his students and members of the public outside his school.\\n“The legal knowledge I gained in the auxiliary force training, as well as crisis management techniques, could be very useful in teaching and contributing towards creating a safer learning environment for my students,” Sin said.\\n“I’ve come across many different types of students in my teaching career. In fact, we all know the younger generation faces many temptations these days. I hope I can guide them to be on the right path.”\\n",

            "title": "To Trump, Asean and Apec are simply platforms for his own agenda",
            "description": "Political leaders like to perform on the global stage and there is no greater “performer” in this regard than US President Donald Trump, who has just been swinging across Asia, doing deals while posing as the best buddy of every national leader he met.\\nThat kind of showmanship may impress people at home and possibly win more political support, but it hijacks the need for genuine diplomacy and international cooperation in both an economic and political sense.\\nTwo cases in point are the most recent summits of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (Asean) in Malaysia and the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (Apec) forum in South Korea. These organisations and the meetings they hold are supposed to be concerned primarily with regional cooperation and integration. Instead, they became platforms for great power politics.\\nSuch gatherings, ostensibly meant to prioritise matters of common interest, are ultimately eclipsed when they become the setting for leaders seeking to resolve bilateral disputes between nations that are not even members of the group in some cases.\\nTrump, for example, stole the limelight at the Apec summit through his meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping. He also effectively claimed credit for a ceasefire between Thailand and Cambodia during his attendance at the Asean summit. Similarly, his meeting with new Japanese Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi, heralding a new “golden age” of bilateral ties, hogged the headlines between the Asean and Apec meetings.\\nThere are issues of critical importance, such as the impact of US tariffs on regional trade, inflated asset prices which threaten a financial crisis, rapidly ageing populations, the so-called middle-income trap and climate change, among other issues, which members of both regional organisations must contend with during summits.\\n\\nHowever, all the hard work undertaken by politicians and bureaucrats in individual Asean or Apec nations in preparation for the summits ends up being overshadowed by the posturing of great powers. Trump’s tariff tantrums have done this to a perhaps unprecedented extent.\\nTrump is undoubtedly skilled in generating publicity around the “art of the deal”, a personal manifesto of the American president, inspired by his book of the same name. He imposes penalties, whether tariffs or sanctions, on other countries and then declares victory by partially rolling them back in return for favours from the countries he is targeting.\\nAs economist Richard Katz observed during a recent panel discussion in Tokyo, Trump scares nations by threatening to amputate both legs – and then only cuts off one.\\nThe implied message in this kind of behaviour is that bullying pays off, that “might is right”, whereas Asian leaders ought to instead condemn US protectionism under Trump while focusing on reinforcing their own regional solidarity and the need to reduce economic dependence on the United States.\\nThere was a relative paucity of economic substance at both the Asean and Apec meetings and even moments of progress were cast into the shadows by the blaze of publicity given to great-power posturing by the leaders and diplomats who attended, notably Trump. While Xi didn’t make it to Kuala Lumpur, he has been a prominent presence in Gyeongju. Moreover, a Russian delegation was present at both summits.\\n\\nAs respective hosts of the two international gatherings, Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim and South Korean President Lee Jae-myung also added to the star line-up at the events and arguably helped distract attention from the business emphasis needed as their countries face economic challenges of one kind or another.\\nIt may be coincidental that these exchanges among great powers took place on the so-called “sidelines” of the Asean and Apec meetings, but this is highly unlikely. The fact is that they provide organisational infrastructure, largely paid for by the host nations, while also providing diplomatic cover for semi-official encounters.\\nThey do not involve formal agreements or treaty obligations between leaders, which are necessary for true and lasting cooperation. By piggybacking on meetings of regional organisations, the leaders of great powers are able to freely make promises in ways that do not match commitments made within the institutional framework of Asean, Apec or other such groupings.\\n\\nTop-down summit diplomacy has its place, of course, but it should not be conducted at the expense of regional business. If Trump wants to gain popularity beyond the borders of the US, he should ensure that his foreign policy does not interfere with or overshadow the routine business of regional organisations, for which he displays only minimal respect at best.\\nThe same criticism might be levelled against political leaders of other great powers such as China and Japan. However, their international agenda is set to some extent by the timing of Trump’s appearance at key summits. They may well feel duty bound to turn up at the same time to preserve credibility or “save face”.\\nLeaders of great powers should not be allowed to turn their backs on globalisation and multilateralism on one hand, while using global or regional multilateral organisations as platforms to attract attention to their own interests and agendas on the other. They should either commit entirely to international cooperation or cease using what remains of it to suit their own ends.\\n",

            "description": "This weekend marks the return of the city’s biggest coffee festival, Coffee Agenda, at PMQ in Central on Hong Kong Island. The event, which kicked off on October 31 and runs until November 2, brings together dozens of top cafes and coffee brands who are showcasing their roasts, award-winning baristas hosting workshops and talks, and plenty to eat, drink and buy.\\nFor your coffee fix the rest of the month, check out these fresh new coffee shops dotted around town – from The Peak to hideaway streets in SoHo.\\n1. Moonary\\nThis supremely elegant coffee shop has its own gravitational pull, offering stillness and respite from the streets of SoHo. The inviting interiors and soft lighting encourage guests to slow down and unwind with a tea or speciality coffee, perhaps paired with a silky pudding, a rich brownie or a banana cake.\\n25 Aberdeen Street, Central\\n2. Halfway Coffee\\nThis beloved home-grown cafe has spawned a new location on The Peak that is perfect for those pre- or post-hike coffees. The space, done up in Halfway Coffee’s signature industrial aesthetic, benefits from lofty ceilings and large windows overlooking greenery and the ocean. Classic brunch plates and quality coffee are staples on the menu.\\n100 Peak Road, The Peak\\n3. Coffganic\\n\\nOpened by Hong Kong’s 2023 barista champion, Penny Pang, this new cafe, housed in Wan Chai’s Hopewell Centre, is set to be a destination for speciality coffee fans.\\nThe setting is equally serious, with an impressive churchlike interior with high ceilings and architecture that evokes the organic curves of Catalan architect and designer Antoni Gaudi, rendered in handsome dark wood.\\nShop 336, Hopewell Centre, 183 Queen’s Road East, Wan Chai\\n4. Haus Coffee Club\\n\\nThis minimalist coffee spot in SoHo keeps its aesthetic simple with its stainless steel facade and worktops, but the diverse brunch menu – the shop makes its own ricotta – and coffee/tea creations are anything but basic. There is even a hidden outdoor seating area out back.\\n32 Staunton Street, Central\\n5. Cuma\\n\\nThis tiny coffee shop feels like a secret hideaway, as it takes some know-how to access – it looks out over the quiet Pak Tsz Lane Park off Hollywood Road. Enjoying a coffee on the benches outside the cafe is just perfect for these cooler autumn days. It also operates as a cocktail bar by night and recently hosted a daytime coffee rave.\\n67 Hollywood Road, Central\\n",

            "title": "China’s robot makers race to roll out low-cost humanoids – but is it sustainable?",
            "description": "A wave of humanoid robot launches in China this year has shaken up the market with eye-catching low prices – though some industry insiders warn the trend might not be financially tainable and could be driven more by hype and capital than by genuine technological progress.\\nBeijing-based Noetix Robotics launched presales for its child-sized humanoid Bumi last week, selling more than 200 units at 9,998 yuan (US$1,408) each within the first three hours. Five hundred units were sold in the first two days, according to the company.\\nMarketed as the world’s first “high-performance humanoid under 10,000 yuan”, Bumi stands at 94cm (37 inches) tall, weighs about 12kg (26.5 pounds) and is seen by some as proof that affordable robots are entering the consumer market.\\nNoetix founder Jiang Zheyuan told reporters at a recent domestic media event that nearly all components were developed in-house, slashing costs. But profit margins are “indeed quite low”, he admitted to reporters.\\nThe company operates a multi-factory production system, with its Beijing facility capable of delivering over 200 units per month. A new plant in Changzhou, Jiangsu province is expected to produce 300 units per month by December, while a third facility in the works could add another 500 units per month. This would bring Noetix’s total capacity to more than 1,000 robots per month, the company said.\\nNoetix has also completed a nearly 300 million yuan (US$42.3 million) pre-B financing round to support mass production.\\nHumanoid robots have become a new battleground as major economies like China and the United States compete for global technological supremacy, with Chinese companies racing to develop cheaper, consumer-friendly models and produce them at scale.\\nBeijing-based Booster Robotics launched its Booster K1 last week – a 95cm (37.4 inches) tall humanoid weighing about 19.5 kilograms (43 pounds) – with the first batch of 100 units priced at 29,900 yuan.\\n\\n\\nIn April, Noetix’s high-performance N2 model went on sale, priced from 39,900 yuan and capable of performing backflips – a major benchmark for a unit&apos;s autonomy and dexterity. Around the same time, Shenzhen-based Engine AI launched its SA01 humanoid on e-commerce platform JD.com for 42,000 yuan.\\nUnitree Robotics also introduced its R1 in late July, priced at about 39,000 yuan – roughly 60 per cent less than its 99,000 yuan G1 model launched last year.\\nBy comparison, humanoid robots are far more costly in the US. Elon Musk has said Tesla’s robots could cost between US$20,000 and US$30,000 once full-scale production is reached, while Agility Robotics’ Digit humanoid initially sold for about US$250,000.\\nDespite the clear price advantage of certain Chinese models, many industry insiders have cast doubt on some pricing strategies.\\nHe Liang, founder of a humanoid robot maker based in Jiangsu province, said some companies were burning money to impress investors before going public.\\n“They’ve found a good niche – targeting family education and household use – which may make sense for companies trying to pave the way for IPOs,” he said. “But for us, we have to choose our battles and stay focused on real products for tourism and industrial clients.”\\nWang Lei, chairman of Shanghai Qingbao Engine Robot, said many companies were probably not making money right now. Instead, they were “scaling up, driving volume and pushing for an IPO as soon as possible”, he said.\\n“The prices are simply too low, so the gross margin is low. Once you factor in other costs, it’s questionable whether they profit at all. That’s why you can’t fight a price war in robotics – a price war would only kill yourself,” he said.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“If no one makes a profit, it will be hard to survive in the industry.”\\nHis company’s robots are priced at about 200,000 yuan, generating tens of millions of yuan in revenue this year.\\nIndustry insiders said few companies would adopt a similar low-cost strategy. “The real players are all focused on industrial applications, aiming to build billion-yuan businesses in the years ahead,” according to He.\\nNoetix did not immediately respond to the Post’s requests for comment.\\nXu Xuecheng, lead scientist at the Zhejiang Humanoid Robot Innovation Center, noted that the business-to-business market has been largely insulated from the hype, as “corporate clients have a clear understanding of the real capabilities of different robots”.\\nWith consumer-facing models still incapable of performing complex tasks for senior care or household services, it remains too early to judge whether humanoid robots have truly entered the consumer market, industry insiders said.\\nXu added that the models are “too limited in function to be considered real [consumer-facing] humanoids, yet still too expensive to be seen as toys.”\\nNoetix’s Bumi model is designed to bring emotional value by accompanying children, teaching them programming or helping them learn English, Jiang told reporters.\\nThe humanoid rental market, meanwhile, has seen a dramatic correction in recent months. The daily leasing fee for Unitree’s G1 humanoid, as high as 20,000 yuan at the beginning of the year, has plunged to about 3,000 to 4,000 yuan on some second-hand platforms.\\n",

            "description": "The fires have long since been extinguished, but in Kathmandu’s devastated government district, the embers of suspicion still smoulder.\\nNearly two months after a Gen Z-led youth uprising swept through Nepal’s capital, forensic teams are working to uncover the origins of the infernos that gutted the country’s courts and ministries, looking for signs of deliberate arson and destroyed evidence.\\n“The extent of the damage was quite shocking,” said Subash Chandra Baral, president of the Nepal Engineers’ Association, citing a preliminary damage assessment undertaken with the Department of Urban Development and Building Construction.\\n“While some sections of the Supreme Court and the Kathmandu District Court have been spared, others have been completely burned. Rooms with case files have been burned down. So you cannot help but think if this was intentional.”\\n\\nIn the Supreme Court alone, an estimated 20,000 case files – many without digital backups – were lost to the blaze, according to court spokesman Nirajan Pandey.\\nThe Kathmandu District Court suffered even heavier losses. Some 445,000 files were incinerated, along with computers and hard drives that were either looted or burned amid the unrest.\\n“It’s suspicious that the crowds would target sections with the case files while not targeting other areas in both the courts, as if they were familiar with the buildings’ layout,” Baral told This Week in Asia.\\n“There are so many questions that need to be answered through a thorough investigation.”\\n\\nBillions in damages\\nThe destruction was not confined to the capital. Nationwide, 688 government offices, 259 private homes, 128 businesses, 198 political party offices and 307 police stations were vandalised or burned during September’s protests, according to official figures.\\nInitial estimates put the cost of the damage at up to 3 trillion rupees (US$21 billion) – nearly half of Nepal’s annual gross domestic product.\\nTourism, a vital pillar of the Himalayan nation’s economy, also took a hit, with major hotels, including the Hilton and Hyatt Regency, temporarily closed due to fire damage. The Hotel Association Nepal has warned of losses of about US$175 million to the sector.\\nThe two days of violence led to the deaths of at least 76 people, including three police officers, and prompted K.P. Sharma Oli’s resignation as prime minister.\\n\\nWhile no conclusive evidence has emerged to prove the fires were deliberately set to destroy legal records, suspicions persist that some blazes may have been coordinated to destroy evidence in corruption cases.\\nInspectors say certain burn patterns suggest deliberately targeted fires.\\nPrabhu Ram Pokharel, a civil engineer who helped retrofit government buildings after a devastating earthquake hit Nepal in 2015, said a post-unrest inspection revealed unusual damage to the basement of the Kathmandu District Court.\\n“The Kathmandu District Court building looks intact from the outside, but the basement looks like it has been bombed,” he said. “There are small craters in the ceiling with light passing through them.”\\nThe Kathmandu District Court building looks intact from the outside, but the basement looks like it has been bombed\\nPrabhu Ram Pokharel, civil engineer\\nPokharel added that the use of locally sourced wooden flooring and other flammable materials in the retrofitting of some government buildings likely contributed to the rapid spread of the fires, as did a delayed firefighting response due to surrounding the chaos.\\nConflicting accounts about timelines have added to the confusion. The Nepali Army said the Supreme Court fire was extinguished a day after it began, but Chief Justice Prakash Man Singh Raut countered in a recent interview that the flames continued smouldering for three days.\\nMeanwhile, footage circulating online shows men wielding what appear to be petrol bombs outside key government buildings. Forensic experts have not ruled out the use of chemical accelerants such as sodium or magnesium, according to a New York Times report citing the Nepal Police’s Central Forensic Science Laboratory.\\n\\nA violent shift\\nLocal newspaper Kantipur also published excerpts from social media chat logs showing discussions shifting from peaceful protest to violent tactics after the police shootings of protesters on September 8, including references to corrosive petrol bombs and home-made napalm.\\nBoth the Supreme Court and Kathmandu District Court are now preparing to file formal police complaints, submitting surveillance footage and social media evidence to help police identify suspects.\\nDeputy Inspector General of Police Binod Ghimire confirmed that a team of experts had collected samples and evidence from the suspected arson sites, with more than 100 people arrested in Kathmandu alone for alleged links to the violence and property damage.\\n\\n“We can only speak based on evidence,” Ghimire said. “It’s natural to have doubts, but we need evidence to confirm if any chemicals were used to set the fires or if they were coordinated.”\\nEngineers warn that buildings structurally weakened by fire damage could pose serious risks in seismically active Nepal if not urgently repaired.\\n“The buildings have burned for days without intervention,” Baral said. “Even a small tremor could damage them more.”\\nAs prosecutors begin filing charges for arson, vandalism and looting, Nepal now faces the harder task of rebuilding public trust. The flames may be out, but the search for truth and accountability has only just begun.\\n",

It means I end up spending more with the restaurant,” Chan said.\\n\\nHe also tried to use a coupon for a lunch of barbecue pork with rice costing HK$78, which meant using one coupon and paying the remainder in cash.\\n“I don’t like the game of coupons; it causes me hassles,” he said, admitting he had not thought too much about the purchase when a saleslady offered it to him.\\nThe Consumer Council said that buying any product or service package amounted to a prepaid purchase, which carried certain risks.\\n“Before making a purchase, consumers should carefully consider their actual needs and carefully read the terms, such as usage restrictions and expiration dates, as well as refund and return policies,” a spokesperson said, advising customers not to overbuy simply because of promotional offers.\\nThe council added that if a merchant were to close, consumers might be unable to recover their prepaid funds.\\nIn the event of liquidation, they could only register as unsecured creditors, and if the merchant became insolvent, the chance of recovering prepaid funds would also be low.\\nThe Post contacted Tai Hing and Cafe de Coral for comment on October 23, but they had yet to respond.\\nCafe de Coral, founded in 1968, reported a nearly 30 per cent fall in net profit to HK$233 million in the last financial year compared with 2023–24. It operates 174 outlets across Hong Kong and 185 in mainland China.\\nThe city’s restaurant sector has struggled in recent years amid changing tastes among mainland visitors and a growing habit among locals of travelling across the border for leisure, leading to a wave of recent closures.\\n",

            "description": "A restaurant in China which lets its staff play popular characters from a famed martial arts novel to interact with customers has trended on mainland social media.\\nXiangyang Courtyard in Xiangyang, Hubei province, central China, which opened in September, features martial arts performances, the Jimu News reported.\\nIt is decorated in the style of classic gardens from ancient China.\\n\\nIn addition, some employees are dressed up as leading characters in the martial arts novel The Legend of the Condor Heroes.\\nThe book, written by the late Hong Kong wuxia novelist Louis Cha Leung-yung who is better known by his pen name Jin Yong, is one of the most popular literary works in the Chinese-speaking world.\\nAccording to some viral videos, one of the restaurant’s workers plays Huang Rong, the heroine of the novel, while serving dishes to customers.\\n\\nAnother employee appears as the character Mei Chaofeng to knead dough because Mei is well known for her skill in killing people using her signature powerful “nine yin skeleton claw”.\\nA third employee appears as Ke Zhene and cooks dishes with his eyes closed as Ke is depicted as blind in the novel.\\nBoth Mei and Ke are villains in the book, while Huang is loved by readers as a witty character with exceptional martial arts skills.\\n\\n“Come to have a look. Guess who that person is. Quick, take a picture,” shouts a thrilled customer in one video.\\nEmployees also do performances on a small stage at 7pm every day.\\n“We have invited a professional performing troupe to teach our staffers to play wuxia characters. We would like to strengthen our restaurant’s wuxia culture feature and improve the customer experience,” Zhu Xiujun, general manager of the restaurant, was quoted as saying.\\nXiangyang has a strong connection with wuxia culture because an important battle happened in the city, according to the novel.\\n\\n“I saw some recommendations about this restaurant on social media. Many people said they had a wonderful experience. So I took my family to try it,” a female customer identified as Zhu told the media.\\nReactions to the eatery were mixed on mainland social media.\\n“It is a creative idea. I also want to experience the wuxia atmosphere there,” said one internet user.\\nHowever, another person said: “Why not spend more effort improving the quality of the food?

I dare not eat it.”\\nChina’s catering industry is highly competitive, making venues try various gimmicks to attract customers.\\nLast year, a restaurant boss in Chongqing, southwestern China, went viral online because of her innovative impersonation of a robot waitress.\\n",

            "description": "Cristina Bucsa raced into the final of the Prudential Hong Kong Tennis Open on Saturday, brushing aside Maya Joint in straight sets.\\nA dominant display from Bucsa showed no mercy to her struggling Australian opponent, whose title hopes were ended by a 6-3, 6-1 margin at Victoria Park Tennis Stadium.\\nJoint matched Bucsa blow for blow in the early games, before the wheels came off her campaign as the first set reached a decisive stage.\\nWhen Bucsa broke to lead 4-3, 19-year-old Joint’s form deserted her. Where Bucsa was controlled and precise, Joint, straining to return fire, began hitting long and wide.
