            "description": "Multiple people who had allegedly been plotting a violent attack over the Halloween weekend were arrested Friday in Michigan, FBI Director Kash Patel said in a social media post.\\nThe law enforcement effort was focused on suburban Detroit. Patel said more information would be released later.\\nInvestigators believe the plot was inspired by Islamic State extremism and are investigating whether those in custody were potentially radicalised online, according to two people briefed on the investigation who could not publicly discuss details. They spoke on condition of anonymity.\\nFBI and state police vehicles were in a neighbourhood near Fordson High School in Dearborn. People wearing shirts marked FBI walked in and out of a house, including one person who collected paper bags and other items from an evidence truck.\\nPolice in Inkster, another suburb, said FBI personnel were at a storage facility there.\\n\\n“There is no current threat to public safety,” said Jordan Hall, an FBI spokesman in Detroit, who declined further comment.\\nThe investigation involved discussion in an online chat room involving at least some of the suspects who were taken into custody, people familiar with the investigation said.\\nThe group had discussed carrying out an attack around Halloween, referring to “pumpkin day”, according to one of the people. The other person briefed on the investigation confirmed that there had been a “pumpkin” reference.\\nIt was not immediately clear if the group had the means to carry out an attack, but the reference to Halloween prompted the FBI to make arrests on Friday, one of the people said.\\nMichigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer said on social media that she had been briefed by Patel. She said she was grateful for “swift action” but offered no details.\\nResidents in the Dearborn neighbourhood watched as investigators worked at the house.\\n“It’s really scary because we have a lot of relatives around this neighbourhood,” said Fatima Saleh, who was next door.\\nSeparately, in May, the FBI said it arrested a man who had spent months planning an attack against a US Army site in suburban Detroit on behalf of the Islamic State group. The man, Ammar Said, did not know that his supposed allies in the alleged plot were undercover FBI employees.\\nSaid remains in custody, charged with attempting to provide support to a terrorist organisation. The criminal complaint was replaced in September with a criminal “information” document, signalling that a plea agreement could be possible in the months ahead.\\n",

            "title": "US judges order Trump administration to continue Snap food aid despite shutdown",
            "description": "Two federal judges ruled nearly simultaneously on Friday that US President Donald Trump’s administration must continue to fund Snap, the nation’s biggest food aid programme, using contingency funds during the government shutdown.\\nThe rulings came a day before the US Department of Agriculture planned to freeze payments to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Programme because it said it could no longer keep funding it due to the shutdown.\\nThe programme serves about one in every eight Americans and is a major piece of the nation’s social safety net.\\nWord in October that it would be a November 1 casualty of the shutdown sent states, food banks and Snap recipients scrambling to figure out how to secure food. Some states said they would spend their own funds to keep versions of the programme going.\\nThe programme costs around US$8 billion per month nationally.\\n\\nDemocratic state attorneys general or governors from 25 states, as well as the District of Columbia, challenged the plan to pause the programme, contending that the administration has a legal obligation to keep it running in their jurisdictions.\\nThe administration said it was not allowed to use a contingency fund with about US$5 billion in it for the programme, which reversed a USDA plan from before the shutdown that said money would be tapped to keep Snap running.\\nThe Democratic officials argued that not only could that money be used, it must be. They also said a separate fund with around US$23 billion was available for the cause.\\nA federal judge in Rhode Island ruled from a bench that the programme must be funded using at least the contingency funds – and asked for an update on progress by Monday.\\nA Massachusetts-based judge also gave the administration until Monday to say whether it would partially pay for the benefits for November with contingency money or fund them fully with additional funds\\nIt was not immediately clear how quickly the debit cards that beneficiaries use to buy groceries could be reloaded after the ruling. That process often takes one to two weeks.\\nThe rulings are likely to face appeals.\\nIn a hearing in Boston on Thursday on a legal challenge filed by the Democratic officials from 25 states, one federal judge seemed sceptical of the administration’s argument that Snap benefits could be halted.\\n\\nUS District Judge Indira Talwani told lawyers that if the government could not afford to cover the cost, there was a process to follow rather than simply suspending all benefits. “The steps involve finding an equitable way of reducing benefits,” said Talwani, who was nominated to the court by former US president Barack Obama.\\nTalwani seemed to be leaning towards requiring the government to put billions of dollars in emergency funds towards Snap. That, she said, was her interpretation of what Congress intended when an agency’s funding runs out.\\n“If you don’t have money, you tighten your belt,” she said in court. “You are not going to make everyone drop dead because it’s a political game someplace.”\\nGovernment lawyers say a contingency fund containing some US$5 billion cannot legally be used to maintain Snap, a programme that costs about US$8 billion a month. The states say it must be used for that purpose and point to more money available in a second federal account with around US$23 billion.\\nTalwani said her ruling would apply nationwide, not just in the states that are part of the challenge. That could defy the intentions of the US Supreme Court, which has limited the use of nationwide injunctions, though it has not prohibited them.\\nMeanwhile, states, food banks and recipients have been bracing for an abrupt shift in how low-income people can get groceries.\\nMost states have announced more or expedited funding for food banks or novel ways to load at least some benefits onto the debit cards used in the programme.\\nAdvocates and beneficiaries say halting the food aid would force people to choose between buying groceries and paying other bills.\\n\\nAt a Washington news conference on Friday, Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins, whose department runs Snap, said the contingency funds in question would not cover the cost of Snap for long.\\nSpeaking at a press conference with House Speaker Mike Johnson at the Capitol, she blamed Democrats for conducting a “disgusting dereliction of duty” by refusing to end their Senate filibuster as they hold out for an extension of healthcare funds.\\nA push this week to continue Snap funding during the shutdown failed in Congress.\\nTo qualify for SNAP in 2025, a family of four’s net income after certain expenses cannot exceed the federal poverty line, which is about US$31,000 per year.\\nLast year, Snap provided assistance to 41 million people, nearly two-thirds of whom were families with children, according to the lawsuit.\\n",

            "description": "Tanzania’s main opposition said hundreds had been killed in three days of election protests, with the country still under an internet blackout on Friday and the government denying any use of “excessive force”.\\nA security source and diplomat in Dar es Salaam both said that deaths were “in the hundreds” as protests continued on Friday.\\nPresident Samia Suluhu Hassan had sought to cement her position and silence critics in her party with an emphatic win in Wednesday’s election, in which her main challengers were either jailed or barred from standing.\\nBut the vote descended into chaos as crowds took to the streets of Dar es Salaam and other cities, tearing down her posters and attacking police and polling stations, leading to an internet shutdown and curfew.\\nForeign Minister Mahmoud Thabit Kombo said his government had “no figures” on any dead.\\n“Currently no excessive force has been used,” he said in an interview with Al-Jazeera. “There’s no number until now of any protesters killed.”\\n\\nBut the main opposition party, Chadema, said casualties were very high.\\n“As we speak the figure for deaths in Dar [es Salaam] is around 350 and for Mwanza it is 200-plus. Added to figures from other places around the country, the overall figure is around 700,” Chadema spokesman John Kitoka said.\\n“The death toll could be much higher,” he warned, saying killings could be happening during the nighttime curfew.\\nThe security source said they were hearing reports of more than 500 dead, “maybe 700-800 in the whole country”.\\nWith foreign journalists largely banned from covering the election and a communications blackout entering its third day, information from the ground has been scarce.\\nThe first toll from an international body came early Friday when the United Nations said it had “credible reports” of 10 dead, while Amnesty International said it had information of at least 100 killed.\\nMultiple hospitals and health clinics were too afraid to talk directly to Agence France-Presse.\\nHassan had yet to comment on the unrest and local news sites have not been updated since Wednesday.\\nArmy chief Jacob Mkunda late Thursday called the protesters “criminals”.\\n\\nIn Zanzibar, a tourist hotspot with its own semi-autonomous government, Hassan’s Revolution Party (Chama Cha Mapinduzi: CCM) had already been declared winner of the local vote on Thursday.\\nThe opposition party, ACT-Wazalendo, rejected the result, saying: “They have robbed the people of Zanzibar of their voice … The only solution to deliver justice is through a fresh election.”\\nA senior party official said that ballot boxes had been stuffed, people allowed to vote multiple times without ID and their election observers kicked out of counting rooms.\\nAt a meeting place for opposition supporters on Zanzibar, there was dismay and fear.\\n“There has never been a credible election since 1995,” said a 70-year-old man, referring to Tanzania’s first multiparty vote.\\nNone of those interviewed gave their names.\\n“We are afraid of speaking because they might come to our houses and pick us up,” said one.\\n\\nHassan has faced opposition from parts of the army and allies of her iron-fisted predecessor, John Magufuli, since she took over upon his death in 2021, analysts say.\\nThey said she wanted an emphatic victory to cement her position, and the authorities banned the main opposition party, Chadema, and put its leader on trial for treason.\\nIn the run-up to the vote, rights groups condemned a “wave of terror” in the east African nation, including a string of high-profile abductions that escalated in the final days.\\nMuch public anger has been directed at Hassan’s son, Abdul Halim Hafidh Ameir, accused of overseeing the crackdown.\\nACT-Wazalendo was allowed to contest the local election in Zanzibar, but its candidate was barred from competing against Hassan on the mainland.\\n",

            "title": "PLA team releases photo of hypersonic ‘morphing’ missile that can change shape at Mach 5",
            "description": "Chinese military scientists have unveiled a rare glimpse into one of the most advanced frontiers of aerospace technology: a prototype of a morphing hypersonic vehicle capable of flying at speeds exceeding Mach 5.\\nThe missile, revealed in a published peer-reviewed paper, features a pair of retractable wings – a groundbreaking design that allows it to dynamically adapt its aerodynamic profile mid-flight.\\nWhen stowed inside the fuselage, the wings minimise drag for high-speed cruising. When extended, they generate additional lift and significantly improve manoeuvrability.\\nCrucially, the degree of wing deployment can be finely adjusted, enabling real-time changes to the vehicle’s overall aerodynamic shape and flight characteristics – a capability long considered the “holy grail” of hypersonic flight.\\nThe design was detailed in a paper published on October 20 in Acta Aeronautica et Astronautica Sinica, China’s leading aerospace journal, by a research team led by Professor Wang Peng from the College of Aerospace Science and Engineering at the National University of Defence Technology (NUDT).\\nThe study confirmed the vehicle’s novel control algorithms and key components had successfully passed hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) ground tests – a critical milestone indicating the system is not just theoretical, but viable for real-world deployment.\\n“High-speed morphing vehicles represent a cutting-edge direction in next-generation aerospace platforms,” the authors wrote.\\n\\n\\n“By dynamically adjusting their structure during flight to adapt to varying aerodynamic conditions, these vehicles demonstrate exceptional adaptability across wide speed and altitude ranges, offering significant potential for multi-role missions and enhanced penetration capabilities.\\n“Compared to traditional fixed-geometry high-speed vehicles, morphing vehicles can optimise aerodynamic performance in response to complex flight environments, dramatically improving manoeuvrability and mission flexibility.”\\nFor years, Chinese scientists have claimed their hypersonic weapons can target not only fixed installations but also highly mobile assets, including advanced stealth fighters like the F-22 and B-21 bomber.\\nThese assertions were met with scepticism – and even ridicule – from many Western experts, who long operated under the assumption that hypersonic missiles sacrifice manoeuvrability for speed. The prevailing dogma held that the faster a vehicle flies, the harder it is to steer.\\nBut China appears to have shattered that paradigm. During a massive parade on September 3, Beijing showcased the Changjian-1000 (CJ-1000) hypersonic cruise missile – a weapon reportedly capable of striking ground targets and engaging moving maritime threats such as aircraft carriers and airborne early-warning aircraft thousands of kilometres away, even if those targets attempt evasive manoeuvres.\\nDespite intense global speculation that the CJ-1000 employs morphing technology to achieve such unprecedented versatility, the missile was displayed fully enclosed in a protective canister, revealing no visible details.\\nNow, Wang’s research offers an extremely rare window into this once-secret technology.\\nControlling a vehicle at hypersonic speeds is inherently difficult. At Mach 5 and above, surface temperatures can exceed 2,000 degrees Celsius (3,632 Fahrenheit), triggering extreme physical and chemical changes in the airframe. Introducing morphing structures – like moving wings – multiplies the complexity.\\nThe shifting geometry generates massive uncertainty in aerodynamic models, demanding extraordinary computational power to calculate stable control commands in real time.\\n\\n\\nYet hypersonic platforms operate under severe constraints: limited on-board power, tight payload space and unforgiving battlefield conditions. The on-board flight computers, while highly reliable, cannot match the processing power of ground-based systems.\\nAs a result, control algorithms must be lightweight, ultra-efficient and resilient – capable of making split-second decisions with minimal delay.\\nEven more challenging is that mechanical actuators moving the wings are subject to inherent lag. Without precise control, these movements can induce high-frequency, destructive vibrations – a phenomenon known as “control chattering”, which can damage the vehicle or destabilise flight.\\nSuppressing such oscillations remains one of the most formidable challenges in morphing vehicle development worldwide.\\nWang’s team has now demonstrated a revolutionary control algorithm specifically designed to overcome these barriers.\\nTheir approach integrates high-order fully actuated system modelling, prescribed performance control and super-twisting sliding mode control – a sophisticated fusion of techniques that achieves high precision and robustness while drastically reducing computational load.\\nCritically, the algorithm has been verified in hardware-in-the-loop experiments, proving it can run in real time on embedded flight processors, similar to those used in actual missiles. In tests, the system achieved attitude tracking errors under 1 degree, with smooth, chatter-free actuator responses – validating its readiness for real-flight applications.\\nBeyond military use, morphing hypersonic technology holds transformative potential for civil aviation: enabling intercontinental flights in an hour or two, point-to-point global transport and efficient space access vehicles for reusable launch systems.\\nYet significant engineering challenges remain. The prototype photo reveals visible gaps where the wings extend – raising questions about thermal sealing under extreme heat, structural integrity and stealth performance.\\nKey challenges include preventing scorching plasma from penetrating the fuselage and minimising the radar cross-section despite moving parts.\\n",

            "description": "Hong Kong’s business sector has echoed a government call to boost the voter turnout rate in the coming Legislative Council election by offering incentives such as a half day of paid leave and transport subsidies to encourage employees to cast their ballots.\\nDeveloper Sino Group was among the first conglomerates leading the drive as it announced it would grant more than 11,000 staff members a half day of leave for voting on December 7 while promoting election awareness internally.\\n“This is particularly important as more than 90 per cent of our 10,000-plus colleagues in Hong Kong are frontline workers, who serve residents, mall and hotel patrons on weekends and Sundays,” Daryl Ng, chairman of Sino Group, told the Post on Friday.\\n“We strongly encourage all colleagues to cast their votes and contribute to Hong Kong’s continued prosperity, stability and good policy advancement.”\\nPeter Lam Kin-ngok, chairman of Lai Sun Development, also urged chambers of commerce and corporations to offer half-day “gratitude” leave to employees who provided a “thank you card” they had obtained after casting their ballots.\\nHe said the suggestion had won the backing of the Hong Kong General Chamber of Commerce, the Federation of Hong Kong Industries and the Chinese Manufacturers’ Association of Hong Kong, among others.\\nThe Hong Kong Tourism Board, a statutory body chaired by Lam which has around 300 staff in the city, said it would provide a half day of paid leave to its employees who needed to work on election day for “their participation in public service and community development”.\\n\\nChief Executive John Lee Ka-chiu earlier urged both public institutions and businesses to encourage employees to take part in the poll, the second under Beijing’s “patriots-only” electoral overhaul.\\nHe also issued a letter to all civil servants urging them to vote and vowed to take a hard line on any disruptions to the election.\\nOrganisations such as the Hong Kong Jockey Club, CLP Power and HK Electric earlier said they would help workers on duty with transport that day.\\nAn insider also said measures such as flexible working hours, transport arrangements and commuting reimbursements would be offered by Hong Kong-based state-owned enterprises, in line with their previous practices in past elections.\\nSecretary for Development Bernadette Linn Hon-ho and security minister Chris Tang Ping-keung on Friday wrote to statutory bodies and groups that work with their bureaus calling on them to back the polls. Secretary for the Civil Service Ingrid Yeung Ho Poi-yan also wrote to the city’s 170,000 government workers.\\nVeteran political commentator Sonny Lo Shiu-hing said Hong Kong faced pressure as Macau’s legislative election in September yielded a voter turnout rate of more than 50 per cent.\\nHe said the city should also put more effort into helping residents understand candidates’ platforms while having more centrists run in the poll would boost voters’ participation.\\nThe 2021 Legco election, the first after Beijing overhauled the city’s electoral system to allow only “patriots” to hold political power, saw a record low turnout of 30.2 per cent.\\n",

            "title": "Americans facing hunger as shutdown enters second month: ‘starting to become very real’",
            "description": "The US government shutdown barrelled towards its second month on Friday and the pain is spreading fast – with federal workers broke, food aid vanishing and millions of Americans caught in the crossfire.\\nWhat started on October 1 as a Washington sideshow has morphed into a slow-motion implosion of public services and a growing economic convulsion, with federal offices dark and President Donald Trump’s government stuck in neutral.\\nRepublicans warned that millions will begin feeling the full force of the shutdown for the first time this weekend, as unresolved fights over funding for healthcare and food stamps make them hungrier and poorer.\\n“Most people haven’t noticed up until this week. Thanks to Donald Trump finding a way to pay our troops last month, that pain was delayed,” Republican House Whip Tom Emmer told Fox News. “But, starting this week … this is starting to become very real.”\\nAt the heart of the fight is money to help Americans cover health insurance under the Affordable Care Act, better known as “Obamacare”.\\n\\nThose subsidies – a lifeline for more than 20 million people – are set to expire at year’s end and, unless Congress acts, premiums will skyrocket by an eye-watering average of 114 per cent when the new sign-up period opens Saturday.\\nBut Washington’s warring parties are locked in a familiar, bitter loop, as Democrats refuse to reopen the government without a deal to extend the subsidies and Trump’s Republicans saying they won’t talk until the lights are back on.\\nAs Washington bickers, the shutdown’s fallout is rippling through everyday life and starting to pinch where it really hurts – the dinner table.\\nThe Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), which helps 42 million low-income Americans buy groceries, is set to run out of funds this weekend.\\nDemocrats have been pushing the White House to use US$5 billion in emergency cash to cover food stamps, but the administration says it cannot legally tap that fund.\\n\\nGlimmers of hope?\\nWith no end to the shutdown in sight, the deadlines are piling up fast.\\nWIC – the food aid programme for pregnant women, new mothers and infants – is also on the brink, while “Head Start” programmes that provide nutrition and family support to 65,000 infants could begin shuttering from Saturday.\\nThe administration says it has scraped together enough money to cover Friday’s payday for active-duty troops, but acknowledges that they could go unpaid by mid-November.\\nSome 670,000 federal workers have been sent home without pay, and another 730,000 – from park rangers to air traffic controllers – are working for nothing. Many missed their entire pay for the first time this week.\\nThe country’s largest federal workers’ union, AFGE, is begging Congress to pass a stopgap bill to get pay cheques flowing again. But even that has become political quicksand, with Democrats holding the line.\\nStill, there are faint signs of life on Capitol Hill.\\nAfter weeks of political trench warfare, a handful of centrist Democrats and pragmatic Republicans have quietly started sketching possible compromises, most hingeing on a commitment to tackle healthcare once the government reopens.\\nSome Democrats are signalling openness to smaller bills to pay workers or keep food aid flowing – signs that both sides may be feeling the heat.\\n\\nAnd looming somewhere in the wings is Trump, whose shadow hangs over every Republican move. Lawmakers on both sides hope he’ll swoop in to broker a deal on the Obamacare subsidies.\\nIn a rare intervention in the crisis, Trump called on Thursday for the Senate to scrap its 60-vote threshold for legislation to pass, which would strip Democrats of all their leverage.\\nHe admonished Republicans on social media that “WE are in power, and if we did what we should be doing, it would IMMEDIATELY end this ridiculous, Country destroying ‘SHUT DOWN.’”\\nAmericans blame Trump and the Republicans over Democrats, by 45 per cent to 33 per cent, according to the latest ABC/Washington Post poll. Independents blame Republicans by a 2 to 1 margin.\\n",
