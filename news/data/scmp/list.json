            "description": "The Los Angeles Dodgers, fuelled by a three-run third inning and another dominant pitching performance from Yoshinobu Yamamoto, beat the Toronto Blue Jays 3-1 on Friday to force a decisive World Series Game 7.\\nThe defending champion Dodgers had to dig deep to thwart the Blue Jays’ ninth-inning rally bid and knot Major League Baseball’s best-of-seven championship series at three games apiece.\\nThey kept their bid for the first title repeat in 25 years alive while the Blue Jays will be aiming to claim their first title in 32 years when they host the decider on Saturday.\\nDodgers pitcher Tyler Glasnow, scheduled to start the final clash, stepped in with Blue Jays runners on second and third with no outs in the ninth.\\nHe induced a fly out from Ernie Clement before Andres Gimenez hit into a game-ending double play.\\n\\n“This is do or die,” Dodgers manager Dave Roberts said of sending in Glasnow after closer Roki Sasaki got into trouble.\\n“You’ve got to leave it all out there and pick up the pieces. Right there I just felt Roki wasn’t as sharp and I felt right there Glas was a guy who had swing and miss stuff and I just wanted to bet on him.”\\nWith their backs against the wall, the Dodgers seized the lead in the third inning – finally making the Blue Jays pay for intentionally walking Shohei Ohtani.\\nBlue Jays starting pitcher Kevin Gausman gave up a one-out double to Tommy Edman and, with two outs, walked Ohtani.\\nWill Smith smacked another double to score Edman and Mookie Betts delivered a hard-hit single to left field that plated another two runs.\\nIt was sweet redemption for Betts, who was dropped to fourth in the order after hitting just .130 in the first five games of the series.\\nGeorge Springer, back for the Blue Jays after missing two games with a muscle injury in his side, pulled back a run with a single in the bottom of the third that plated Addison Barger – who led off the frame with a double.\\nThe Blue Jays threatened with two outs in the sixth when Vladimir Guerrero Jr. belted a double to left field.\\nYamamoto then walked Bo Bichette on seven pitches – his first walk issued in 15-plus innings – but the Japanese ace struck out Daulton Varsho to escape the danger.\\nThat pushed Yamamoto’s pitch count to 96, and the Dodgers turned to their bullpen to preserve the lead, Yamamoto departing after giving up one run in six innings with six strikeouts and one walk.\\nReliever Justin Wrobleski pitched a scoreless seventh and Sasaki squeaked through a tense bottom of the eighth, giving up a single to Springer and walking Guerrero.\\nBut the Blue Jays couldn’t find a way back.\\n",

            "title": "Rosewood Schloss Fuschl is a 15th-century Austrian castle turned luxury lakeside retreat",
            "description": "Austrians are passionate about many things, from mountains to music, but I was surprised to learn that Schloss Fuschl, a 15th-century hunting lodge turned luxury hotel, is also loved and revered by many.\\nThis iconic landmark holds cultural and emotional significance – it was featured in the popular Sissi films about Empress Elisabeth and boasts an idyllic location on one of the country’s most beautiful lakes, a place where many have fond memories of bathing in the turquoise waters surrounded by the majestic Alps.\\nAlthough Schloss Fuschl was transformed into a hotel in the late 1940s, it made headlines when it was crowned the newest jewel in the Rosewood Hotels portfolio in 2022. A two-year renovation followed as the public waited with bated breath to see what would become of their beloved castle.\\n\\nAs soon as I arrive at the hotel, I feel as though I’ve been transported onto a film set. The extensive grounds are dominated by the original “castle”, which features a traditional turret. There is even a picturesque church as well as a fishery specialising in smoked fish and daily catches.\\nTransforming a heritage hotel is no easy feat as it often requires a delicate balance between respecting the property’s original historical charm and introducing modern elements and amenities. Rosewood has ticked boxes with the hotel’s 98 rooms and suites, which are split between the main building and historic tower. These include six free-standing chalets located on the lake, which are designed for families with their dedicated butlers and plenty of privacy.\\nThe main building features rooms and suites offering elegant and contemporary design touches including the hotel’s signature marble bathrooms. I end up in one of the heritage rooms in the castle. It has a sense of old-world nostalgia with its beautifully restored wooden wardrobe, writing desk and window-side banquettes, from where I can take in the mesmerising lake views.\\n\\nSalzburg is a short drive away, but there is plenty to see and do on site. Four restaurants highlight regional cuisine and local ingredients sourced in the area (they even produce their own honey).\\nThe glass-encased Seeterrasse is my go-to spot with its expansive views and dishes like Wiener schnitzel. The dark wood interiors of Schloss Restaurant take you back in time, but it serves more innovative takes on the hearty traditional classics you’ll find at the hotel’s more rustic outpost, Vinothek. For those with a sweet tooth – Austrians love their cakes – there is the cosy Sisi Teesalon, offering favourites like Esterházy, a layered hazelnut torte.\\n\\nTo work off all the food – or just be pampered – it’s worth visiting the 15,000 sq ft Asaya Spa with two pools, a hairdressing salon and a gym. I prefer being outdoors, so I head for the 11km circular hiking trail around the lake through green pastures dotted with cows and sheep. My visit was during the summer, so I was able to enjoy the seasonal lakefront Seeclub, complete with chic cabanas, umbrellas and loungers. There’s no better feeling than jumping into its clear waters for daily cold plunges.\\nAnother highlight during my stay is a private boat cruise on a traditional Zille – Rosewood’s version is electric in keeping with its goals in sustainability – complete with local charcuterie and sparkling tea. My captain is the hotel’s concierge, who has been working in the area for 20 years, and it’s fascinating to hear all his stories. He points out houses owned by famous residents including Russian oligarch Roman Abramovich.\\n\\nBack on land, be sure not to miss the hotel’s newly acquired art collection of old masters, one of the biggest private collections outside a museum. It’s quite something to stroll down the corridors while taking in priceless works by François Boucher, Friedrich von Nerly and other European artists. Another nice touch is the on-site Sisi Museum, dedicated to the country’s beloved Empress Elisabeth, and filled with memorabilia from the films and other rare items from her archives.\\nA perfect blend of past and future, Rosewood Schloss Fuschl will continue to enchant tourists and locals alike for years to come.\\nThe author stayed as a guest of Rosewood Schloss Fuschl.\\n",

            "title": "Atomic ambitions: Singapore eyes the nuclear option for a net-zero future",
            "description": "Land-scarce Singapore officially remains non-committal about building a nuclear reactor, but experts say all signs point to the city state turning to atomic energy to meet its net-zero goals by 2050.\\nThe discourse around civilian nuclear energy has picked up in recent years, with Singapore studying its deployment, developing expertise and partnering with established companies and nuclear nations such as the United States and France to prepare for a possible shift.\\nThe government, however, maintains that it is still weighing its options and says no final decision on nuclear has been made.\\nIn his budget speech in February, Prime Minister Lawrence Wong pledged an additional S$5 billion (US$3.85 billion) for Singapore’s Future Energy Fund to develop clean energy infrastructure “be it in electricity imports, hydrogen or nuclear”.\\n\\nAsked whether the compact, 735 sq km (284 square-mile) nation should harness nuclear energy to meet its climate goals, Alvin Chew, a senior fellow at the S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies who researches civilian nuclear energy, was unequivocal.\\n“Absolutely. The only type of renewable that is viable in Singapore is solar power,” Chew said.\\n“However, solar power incurs a very large footprint, and with its small land area, it is estimated that solar power can only form about 10 per cent of its future electricity mix. Nuclear energy, due to its high energy density, is the only clean form of energy that is suitable for a small country.”\\nIn July, Rafael Grossi, director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), called Singapore “the most perfect example of a country that needs nuclear energy”.\\n“With a very small nuclear power plant, you can have a level of energy density and production that you cannot match with anything else,” he said, predicting that Singapore could have its first reactor “within a few years” – potentially through cooperation with its Asean neighbours.\\nPublic unease remains a concern, however. Chew said one of Singapore’s biggest challenges would not be technical but psychological: convincing citizens adequate emergency systems exist to handle a nuclear incident.\\n“Regardless of how technology has evolved, no engineering system can claim to be risk-free, and therefore it is still necessary to prepare the public on how to respond to an emergency.”\\nVictor Nian, co-founder of the Centre for Strategic Energy and Resources think tank, voiced similar reservations.\\n“Public acceptance and confidence are important in supporting any successful nuclear power programme,” he told This Week in Asia. “[They] require sustained public engagement, education and a clear demonstration of how modern nuclear technologies differ from those of the past.”\\n\\n\\nTo reassure citizens, the city state on Monday released a government background paper outlining its nuclear capability development efforts, coinciding with the launch of Singapore International Energy Week.\\nThe report emphasised that nuclear power has historically resulted in lower death and accident rates than many other energy sources. Still, it acknowledged that disasters such as Chernobyl and Fukushima had “created a worry that nuclear technology is unsafe”.\\nModern reactor designs, such as next-generation small modular reactors (SMRs), have adopted stricter regulations and lessons from past catastrophes, significantly cutting accident risks. SMRs use passive cooling mechanisms driven by gravity and air circulation rather than external power or human-operated pumps, potentially making them more resilient in emergencies, according to the paper.\\nDesigned for scalability, SMRs have a smaller output, which simplifies safety systems. The Rolls-Royce SMR currently being built in the UK, for instance, will fit within an area the size of three football pitches while producing 470 megawatts of low-carbon energy, comparable to more than 150 onshore wind turbines.\\nYet Nian urged careful adoption of the new technology. “It is generally advisable to observe the deployment and performance of second- or third-of-a-kind projects before committing to deployment to prioritise public safety,” he said.\\n“Achieving readiness for such adoption also requires sustained investment in upskilling the workforce to ensure the availability of qualified professionals capable of supporting safe and effective implementation.”\\nSingapore’s National Environment Agency has already linked up with regulators from France, Finland and the United States, and has consulted the Swedish Nuclear Fuel and Waste Management Company on best practices for the safe handling of radioactive and nuclear waste.\\n\\nWhich reactor?\\nOf the 70-plus SMR designs under development, only two are operational today: Russia’s Akademik Lomonosov, the world’s first floating nuclear power plant, which began generating power from twin 35MW SMRs in 2020; and the Chinese state-owned Huaneng Group’s 200MW SMR at Shidao Bay, which started feeding electricity into Shandong province’s grid last December. Neither reactor is available commercially.\\nWhile China’s Shidao Bay deployment represented a technological leap, the country’s global reach remains limited – with only six overseas nuclear projects – compared with Russia’s Rosatom, which has built 20 reactors abroad as of October, according to a recent report from strategic advisory firm The Asia Group.\\nThat report also noted a surge of nuclear interest across the Association of Southeast Asian Nations over the past two years as regional energy demand soars.\\nJennifer Schuch-Page, the firm’s managing principal, told This Week in Asia that while nuclear power features in several Asean members’ energy transition plans, challenges run the gamut from licensing and financing to supply chains, waste management and liability.\\nStill, “public opinions on nuclear seem to be changing in the region,” she said. “Seeing advanced nuclear projects develop elsewhere in the world is likely to strengthen public confidence.”\\n\\nAfter scrapping its nuclear plans in 2016 over safety and cost concerns, Vietnam revived its Ninh Thuan project last December. On the sidelines of last weekend’s Asean summit in Kuala Lumpur, Prime Minister Pham Minh Chinh and Russian Deputy Prime Minister Alexey Overchuk agreed to accelerate nuclear cooperation, with Vietnam aiming to operate its first plant by early 2030.\\nIndonesia has begun regulatory reviews, while Malaysia has engaged the IAEA on capacity building and, in July, launched negotiations with the US for a civil nuclear cooperation framework known as a “123 Agreement”.\\nSingapore signed its own 123 Agreement with Washington last year. In September, the US added both Singapore and the Philippines to its list of countries authorised to recieve nuclear technology exports, a key step towards future commercial collaboration.\\nOn Monday, Singapore’s Energy Market Authority signed new deals with the Idaho National Laboratory and Battelle Memorial Institute, two American nuclear research organisations, to strengthen its technical capabilities.\\nThis Week in Asia has contacted the authority for comment on whether geopolitical factors affect Singapore’s partnership choices.\\nIf Singapore does move ahead, it would do so as a newcomer outside the Nuclear Suppliers Group export control regime, meaning it must work with supplier nations to ensure compliance with international safety, security and safeguards standards. Chew estimated that, based on the IAEA’s milestone framework, building a reactor could take between 10 and 15 years.\\nOnly a handful of countries export commercial nuclear reactors. These include China, the US, France and Russia.\\n\\nIn September, Foreign Minister Vivian Balakrishnan cautioned against a binary mindset that Singapore must choose between Washington and Beijing for advanced technology.\\n“We are a technocratic and technophilic system,” he said. “I don’t care where it [the technology] comes from, but we will do business honestly, and we will not play games, and we will live up to our word.”\\nNian agreed, describing Singapore’s approach as “technology and vendor-neutral” – focused on what works best rather than allegiance.\\nChew added that political support would also be needed, pointing to how the US had backed Japan’s controversial release of treated Fukushima waste water as an example of diplomatic weight shaping outcomes.\\nUltimately, experts say Singapore’s nuclear future, if it arrives, will go far beyond the reactor itself. It will depend on mastering an ecosystem of expertise, fuel supply, regulatory rigour and waste management.\\n“Singapore is likely to adopt a strategy to learn from the best practices in the US, China and other leading nuclear states, while developing a programme that would work in Singapore’s context,” Nian said.\\n",

            "description": "Details of the first joint Russian-Chinese submarine exercise have been published in a military magazine, which said the two countries had shared sonar data and carried out rescue exercises.\\nThe exercise in early August involved two Kilo-class diesel-electric attack submarines, the Russian Volkhov and Chinese Great Wall 210, with two Russian surface ships providing support throughout the exercise.\\nThe 15-day exercise took place after the Joint Sea 2025 exercise involving the two navies in the Sea of Japan, also known as the East Sea.\\nAccording to China’s Ordnance Industry Science Technology magazine, the two subs passed through the Tsushima Strait that divides South Korea and Japan, entering the East China Sea before finally returning to their bases, covering around 2,000 nautical miles (3,700km or 2,302 miles) in total.\\n“[It] sent a clear message to the United States … underwater dominance in the western Pacific is no longer to be monopolised by a single power,” the magazine said, adding that the exercise had also shown the high levels of strategic trust between the two countries.\\nThe series of operations near Japan, held around the anniversary of the country’s surrender in World War II, was also a gesture against the US-Japan alliance, the report said.\\nAs part of the patrol, the two submarines practised detecting simulated enemy submarines, while also sharing sonar data.\\nThey also carried out a “mutual rescue” drill and were joined by one Russian and one Chinese rescue boat to deal with emergency calls from the other countries’ subs – an exercise that required information sharing and interoperability, the report added.\\nThe two sides also shared air defence radar data to intercept targets during the earlier joint exercise and shared key sensor data on anti-submarine warfare.\\nAll these exchanges of highly sensitive information underscored “a deep mutual trust in core military areas”, the report said.\\nIt also said that before the exercises, the Great Wall 210 had shown its stealth qualities by successfully passing through the heavily monitored Tsushima Strait without triggering US underwater sonar arrays.\\n\\n\\nChina selected the Great Wall 210 for the patrol because it was a Russian-made 636 Kilo submarine with similar qualities to the Volkhov, a 636.3 version, the report said.\\nThe Kilo class is one of the world’s most widely exported diesel-electric submarines, featuring a low acoustic signature. It is primarily designed for anti-submarine and anti-surface warfare on the high seas or along the coast.\\nChina imported 12 of the submarines in the 1990s and early 2000s, 10 of which are still active.\\nThis year was the 11th edition of the Joint Sea exercise, an exercise that started in 2012 and has been held every year since then apart from 2018, 2020 and 2023.\\nMost previous editions took place in the northwestern Pacific – including the Japan, Yellow and East China Seas – but some have also been held in the Baltic and Mediterranean. They have featured a range of defensive and offensive drills as well as search and rescue operations and tests of interoperability between the forces – for example, landing helicopters on each other’s ships.\\nSince 2021, the exercises have also featured joint patrols in the Sea of Japan and northwest Pacific.\\n",

            "description": "A new guided history tour, organised by a local cultural enterprise, takes visitors through the fortifications and battle-scarred landscapes near Wong Nai Chung Gap, focusing on Hong Kong’s defence during the second world war against Japanese forces, as the city reinvents its tourism offerings.\\nCreated by Walk in Hong Kong, the tour aims to leverage wartime history as a form of “war relic tourism” to deepen appreciation of the city’s heritage.\\n“Most people in Hong Kong learn about the Japanese Occupation from school textbooks. We tend to think of it as a bitter, hard fight, and while we read about the details, there is not much known content about it,” said Walk in Hong Kong co-founder and chief executive officer Paul Chan Chi-yuen, explaining the purpose of designing this tour.\\nHe also said many places around the world highlighted their war relics as a form of tourism, noting that he believed Hong Kong could do the same.\\nDuring his latest policy address in September, Chief Executive John Lee Ka-chiu pledged to develop a variety of new visitor attractions, including an initiative called “Chinese Cultural Celebrities Rescue”, as part of the government’s efforts to promote “red tourism”.\\nRed tourism refers to tourism products or themes significant to communism.\\n\\nGuided by history teacher and author Rusty Tsoi Yiu-lun, the excursion focuses on the intense fighting around December 19, 1941, when Japanese invasion forces clashed with Allied defenders on Hong Kong Island.\\n“We will see relics that have been neglected, others that have undergone some restoration and some that lie right beneath our feet, so close that we do not even notice them,” Tsoi said.\\nThe tour visits a series of military relics, many of which were constructed during the mid to late 1930s, according to Tsoi.\\nStructures such as gun emplacements, pillboxes and coastal defences were built during the period of “appeasement”, when Britain actively fortified the colony to buy time.\\nA recurring theme on the route was the resilience of the Allied fortifications, often attributed to Hong Kong’s thriving industries at the time.\\nFrom fence poles to water tanks, these structures were extensively built using high-quality reinforced concrete sourced from local producers.\\n\\n“The reason was that we had the Green Island Cement factory and steel bar factories, which made the materials very affordable,” Tsoi said.\\n“So this, in fact, is also very telling of the kinds of industries Hong Kong had in the 1930s.\\n“This was our unique advantage because at that time, the Green Island Cement factory had already been in Hong Kong for half a century.”\\nAccording to the tour, this made the pillboxes and shelters exceptionally robust, posing a significant challenge to the Japanese forces.\\nStops along the way include a former small-arms storage depot, which Tsoi noted is slowly being reclaimed by nature due to lack of maintenance.\\nThe site was originally used for storage and later served as the foundation for a grass-hut mess hall for soldiers.\\nTsoi said that after the battle, the mess hall platform was used to hold more than a hundred Allied prisoners of war overnight without food, water, or medical supplies.\\nAnother site was an ammunition store designed for anti-aircraft guns, bearing several battle marks, including shallow dents from shrapnel and deeper pits from rifle bullets.\\nOne section of the store was designed as a “dry zone” to keep fuses and shells separate and was later repurposed in the 1950s as an emergency first aid station, complete with boxes of saline, anaesthesia and bandages left behind.\\nOne particular pillbox had the unique feature of an observation shaft that allowed officers to spot targets, but it was also a vulnerability.\\nTsoi recounted a story about the Eurasian company Hong Kong Volunteer Defence Corps, in which two people reacted swiftly upon hearing Japanese soldiers on the roof.\\n\\nThe Hong Kong University graduate and his superior managed to warn their unit to take cover near the entrance before two Japanese grenades were dropped down the shaft, thereby saving the lives of the soldiers inside.\\nBullet holes from the gunfire that followed, along with grenade fragments, remain visible on the interior walls.\\nThe tour also highlights new historical findings that challenge previous narratives of the battle.\\nTsoi said that the Japanese advance into the critical Wong Nai Chung Gap was not a pre-planned, intentional strategy to divide the island.\\nInstead, Japanese forces, unfamiliar with the terrain, accidentally stumbled into the gap after being misdirected by the island’s network of catchwaters.\\nThe original Japanese plan to capture the key high ground within 24 hours ultimately took seven days, largely due to fierce and unexpected resistance, as well as their own terrain-induced miscalculations, he explained.\\nThe final stop of the tour is the area around the former command headquarters, which was used by Allied leadership, including Major-General Christopher Maltby and Brigadier John Lawson, the highest-ranking Canadian officer killed in the battle.\\nThe location was where Lawson died.\\n",

Share your views by emailing us your Letter to the Editor at letters@scmp.com or filling in this Google form. Submissions should not exceed 400 words\\nThe recent debate over permitting dogs in restaurants may seem a niche issue but highlights broader tensions between cultural sensitivities and evolving social norms in Hong Kong.\\nIslamic teachings place profound emphasis on ritual purity, with dogs traditionally regarded as ritually impure. Beyond religious considerations, public health science raises concerns about allowing dogs in food establishments. While vaccinated pets pose a relatively low risk, contamination from fur and parasites can compromise hygiene standards.\\nHong Kong’s long-standing Food Business Regulation has prohibited dogs – except service animals – from entering food premises since 1994. This law prioritises food safety and protects vulnerable populations. Numerous countries maintain similar restrictions for this reason. Cats generally face fewer restrictions due to different behaviours and lower perceived risks in dining spaces.\\nAllowing dogs inside halal-certified venues risks eroding Muslim diners’ trust in the sanctity and cleanliness of these spaces. It may challenge Hong Kong’s aspiration to be a truly Muslim-friendly destination.\\nThe government recently announced plans to introduce a licensing system for designated restaurants to allow dogs on the premises. Proposed implementation around mid-2026 will create pet-friendly spaces in response to rising pet ownership.\\nHowever, this demands a balanced approach. Policymakers might consider initially confining pet access to outdoor seating areas rather than enclosed dining rooms. Such measured steps would accommodate pet owners while safeguarding comfort and health for all diners – especially those with religious or health concerns.\\nHong Kong must weigh how to embrace pet-friendly trends without compromising the legitimate concerns of its diverse population. Achieving such balance is vital to preserving the city’s inclusive, cosmopolitan identity and its hard-earned reputation as a welcoming place for all.\\nIlnur Minakhmetov, Yau Ma Tei\\nLet’s learn to live in gratitude\\nI refer to the letter, “Rebuild a culture rooted in filial piety and gratitude” (October 24). I can’t agree more with your correspondent, who wrote: “Nowadays, gratitude seems to be lacking.”\\nGratitude is hard to cultivate among Hongkongers. If they are young and at school, they expend all their energy surviving one exam after another. If they are working for a living and already hard-pressed, they can only focus on keeping their jobs and earning money. The aged tend to prioritise their health. Simply put, everyone has their own concerns. There’s hardly space nor time for delicate feelings whatsoever.\\nWhen relationship problems, competition and mental health issues come into play, things get more complicated and many of us become more self-centred.\\nAfter all, we deserve the good things in our lives because we’ve worked hard for them. Who should we be thankful for other than ourselves?\\nIt gets easy for us to disregard the poor, the unemployed and the sick, not to mention all the efforts others have made to make our environment more pleasant and liveable. This is how we end up taking things for granted.\\nActually, there are plenty of people around us we can and should thank, besides our parents. Teachers, for example, exert themselves to impart knowledge and skills to the young.\\nThink of the people who work in different fields – construction workers, postal workers, salespersons, medical practitioners, drivers, waiters and tech workers. Don’t they all deserve our appreciation and gratitude? Without them, life would be quite impossible.\\nWhen we learn to live in gratitude, we’ll develop love in our hearts and charity in our deeds. May Hong Kong become a city of gratitude one day.\\nJacqueline Kwan, Sai Ying Pun\\nTime to go house hunting\\nIt seems real estate prices are bottoming out from their peak in 2021. We could be looking at a turning point in the market as money flows back to the city. As central banks cut rates, investors can be expected to plough their money back into properties. This being Hong Kong, property prices can rise very fast as the scarcity factor kicks back in.\\nThis might be the best time to hunt for and buy assets in Hong Kong. If you don’t catch this fish now, you might regret it next year. That’s Hong Kong for you, a financial centre that can attract global talent and a city with a great vibe.\\nRishi Teckchandani, Mid-Levels\\n",

            "description": "Five months after a glitzy groundbreaking ceremony just outside Hanoi, the area where The Trump Organisation-branded US$1.5 billion luxury golf resort was unveiled remains just fields of banana and orange trees as angry farmers challenge the site’s clearance plans.\\nThe project in Vietnam’s Hung Yen province is facing land recovery delays as residents contest the amount of compensation being offered by local authorities.\\nIt has been set at about 320,000 dong (US$12) per square metre (10 square feet) – equivalent to around one year’s income from the agricultural land for many of the farmers, plus rates that differ for varying plants and trees already there.\\n“It’s unreasonable that freshly planted crops can get a higher payment than trees that have been growing for 20 years,” said Do Thi Vung, who has spent more than 30 years cultivating land in the area. She is among hundreds of farmers who have petitioned authorities to at least double the compensation rate.\\n\\nThe resort, when finished, is set to feature five-star hotels, golf courses and residential estates spanning around 900 hectares (2,220 acres) along the Red River. The first phase is slated to be complete by late 2027, with the whole complex ready by 2029.\\nThe Trump Organisation’s Executive Vice-President Eric Trump said in May the project will “blow everybody away”.\\nUntil that can happen, however, Hung Yen officials need to hand over the land to the developer, Kinh Bac City Development Holding.\\nThe process has been held up not only because farmers are holding out but due to a huge government overhaul earlier this year that saw three tiers of local bureaucracy reduced to two.\\n“There are definitely delays,” said Le Trung Kien, an official in Chau Ninh, a commune in Hung Yen province. The work to clear the land was assigned in late June but stalled and only restarted in August, he said.\\nSource of friction\\nLand disputes are a long-standing source of social friction in Vietnam.\\nFarmers frequently complain that official compensation prices are set below market value, while the reclamation process can be open to corruption.\\nSuch grievances have occasionally erupted into protests – in one 2020 clash over land rights in Dong Tam commune, four people were killed.\\nThe government last year passed an amended land law aimed at narrowing the gap and improving transparency.\\nIn Hung Yen’s case, the province’s top administrators have ordered compensation plans be finalised by the end of October and 95 per cent of the land clearance be completed by the end of the year. But notices detailing payment amounts have only just been posted in some areas, triggering a 30-day period for public feedback.\\n\\nA representative of Hung Yen Provincial People’s Committee was not immediately available to comment.\\nIf disputes remain unresolved, the process could drag on with a discussion period of up to 60 days required to take place before compulsory land seizure can happen, according to Hoang Thi Oanh, a lawyer and director of Lion Law Firm.\\nSome 4 trillion dong has been earmarked for compensation and resettlement, according to a Hung Yen provincial news website.\\n“If people don’t agree, it will be very hard, even impossible, to achieve the target,” said Le Van Luong, the head of the project management board in Chau Ninh commune.\\nThe 320,000 dong per square metre payment has been calculated based on government regulations, he said. In Vietnam, land is collectively owned by the people and managed by the state, which grants land use rights in accordance with the law.\\nDang Thanh Tam, chairman of Kinh Bac City Development, said the developer had “received 100 hectares of land and expects the remaining 300 hectares for the first phase no later than January”.\\n“The inauguration of two VIP golf courses to welcome the Apec leader summit in November 2027 is completely feasible. The project is still on good schedule,” Tam said.\\nRepresentatives from The Trump Organisation did not respond to requests for comment.\\nPlanted evidence\\nComplicating matters, farmers are also now arguing about specific plants. Lilies appeared overnight in some places, residents said earlier this week, brought in from elsewhere and planted to add value for the official assessment.\\nThe approval process for the resort, which is a collaboration between Hung Yen Hospitality, a subsidiary of Kinh Bac City Development, and The Trump Organisation, took place as Vietnam’s government sought to stave off a threatened 46 per cent tariff on exports to the US – levies that were later reduced to 20 per cent.\\n\\nThe timeline was swift. After first being signed in September last year, the project received investment approval in May, with the launch ceremony taking place just a few days later.\\nStanding on a stage alongside Eric Trump at the event, Prime Minister Pham Minh Chinh pledged the government’s full backing and urged officials to actively support the project to have it ready in time for the Apec summit in late 2027.\\nThe Trump Organisation is set to receive US$5 million in licence fees for the project, according to a financial disclosure report released by the US Office of Government Ethics. It is not understood to be involved in the construction phase or compensation discussions.\\nFarmers unwilling to accept the offer can lodge a legal complaint. But as the rates are usually calculated and approved by authorities through an appraisal process in line with the law, their chances of securing a higher payment are slim, according to lawyer Oanh.\\nLives here had been “closely connected to the land for many years”, said Van Thi Thuan, head of Nam Mau village in the affected area. “Crops help raise the whole family,” she said.\\n“Farmers are willing to hand over the land for development though many will be jobless, many will struggle, but the compensation is too low for them.”\\n",

            "title": "North Korean denuclearisation ‘a pipe dream’, Pyongyang warns ahead of Seoul-Beijing talks",
            "description": "Hours before South Korea and China were set to hold their first summit, North Korea sought to set the tone by dismissing any discussion of its denuclearisation as a “pipe dream”.\\nChinese President Xi Jinping and South Korean President Lee Jae-myung are scheduled to hold their first face-to-face talks on Saturday on the sidelines of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit in the southeastern city of Gyeongju.\\nSeoul has said it hopes to raise the issue of North Korea’s denuclearisation during the meeting.\\nOn Saturday, North Korea’s Vice Foreign Minister Pak Myong-ho condemned the South for seeking to raise the topic whenever an opportunity arose.\\n“Denuclearisation is a ‘pipe dream’ which can never be realised even if it talks about it a thousand times,” Pak said in a statement carried by state media Korean Central News Agency.\\nSouth Korea still remained unaware that “struggling to deny the DPRK’s position as a nuclear weapons state and talking about its daydream of realising the denuclearisation just reveals its lack of common sense,” he added, using North Korea’s official name, the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea.\\n\\nAnalysts said the North’s statement appears aimed at deterring Seoul and Beijing from discussing denuclearisation at the summit, while also signalling a message to China.\\n“This statement is meant to prevent China and South Korea from discussing the denuclearisation issue as the most important topic at today’s summit,” Yang Moo-jin, a professor at the University of North Korean Studies, told This Week in Asia.\\nNoting that Pak was the vice foreign minister in charge of Asian and China affairs, he added: “It is also designed as a message targeting Beijing that it should avoid this topic at the summit.”\\nBeijing has traditionally emphasised three principles for peace on the Korean peninsula: denuclearisation, peace and the resolution of disputes through dialogue.\\nHowever, according to Yang, China appears to be shifting its emphasis away from denuclearisation towards the latter two principles.\\nThis move, he said, coincided with a deepening bloc-to-bloc confrontation between the United States and its allies on one side and Russia, China and North Korea on the other.\\n“South Korea wants to put the North’s denuclearisation high on the summit agenda, but China is expected to be selective in discussing it, raising instead the issue of the South seeking to build nuclear-propulsion submarines,” Yang said.\\n\\n\\nCho Han-bum, a senior researcher at the Korea Institute for National Unification, said Pyongyang was also “expressing its displeasure with President Xi visiting the South and sitting down with Lee for a summit”.\\nIn another apparent show of discontent, the North on Tuesday test-fired a “strategic” cruise missile in the Yellow Sea, shared with China, just hours before President Donald Trump arrived in South Korea during the final leg of his Asian trip, Cho noted.\\nIn May last year, North Korea denounced South Korea for reaffirming its commitment to the denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula in a joint declaration issued after a summit among the leaders of South Korea, China and Japan.\\nPyongyang rejected the trilateral summit’s call as a “blatant challenge” to its sovereign rights and “wanton interference” in its internal affairs.\\nNuclear sub approval\\nTrump said on Thursday he had given South Korea approval to build a nuclear-powered submarine at a Philadelphia shipyard operated by South Korea’s Hanwha Ocean.\\nChina’s foreign ministry the same day urged Seoul and Washington to uphold their nuclear non-proliferation obligations.\\n“China hopes that both South Korea and the US will practically implement their nuclear non-proliferation obligations, and take actions conducive to regional peace and stability, rather than doing the opposite,” Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Guo Jiakun said during a press briefing.\\nSouth Korea’s Chief of Naval Operations Kang Dong-gil told the National Assembly on Thursday that once a decision was made, it would take roughly 10 years to build a nuclear-powered submarine.\\nKang said the vessels would be 5,000 tonnes (5,500 tons) or larger, and the uranium enrichment level for the submarine’s fuel would remain at or below 20 per cent, reflecting its peaceful purpose.\\nUnder the Navy’s Changbogo-III (KSS-III) programme to acquire advanced diesel-electric attack submarines, South Korea has already commissioned three 3,000-tonne submarines for active duty.\\nThe country launched its first 3,600-tonne submarine last week.\\n\\nDefence Minister Ahn Gyu-back has said he believes South Korea should acquire four or more nuclear-powered submarines, adding that if Seoul builds them, it would have “huge military significance” in countering North Korea’s nuclear capabilities.\\nDespite Trump’s “political-level approval,” Yu Ji-hoon, a research fellow at the Korea Institute for Defence Analyses, said that “institutional, legal, technical, and diplomatic procedures and challenges still lie ahead”.\\nSouth Korea must first strengthen the perception in Washington that its nuclear-powered submarine programme serves US national interests, according to Yu.\\n“What’s important now is to broaden support among key figures in the US policy and defence circles,” he said.\\n",

            "title": "Chinese stocks: Investors study Beijing’s 5-year plan for hints on future market forces",
            "description": "Over the past week, investors hoping for an extension of this year’s blistering, tech-led run on Chinese equities have been poring over – and reading between the lines of – a draft of Beijing’s plan for economic and social development in the next five years.\\nThe blueprint emerged from a four-day Communist Party plenum that concluded on October 23, during which party chief Xi Jinping and the all-powerful Central Committee pledged to advance core technologies from semiconductors to artificial intelligence to quantum computing. They also highlighted tech self-reliance, domestic consumption and improving people’s livelihoods as key goals for 2026-2030.\\nThe Communist Party issued a summary of the development goals on the day the plenum ended, and a week later released the detailed proposal. While the five-year plan will not be finalised until the legislative National People’s Congress in March, the initial details are enough to reshape the investment landscape and help traders identify key medium-term opportunities.\\n“The five-year plan is expected to reset investment themes and the valuation system on the capital market,” said Wang Jun, a strategist at BOC International in Shanghai. “The new productive force represented by tech self-reliance, the green transition and an upgrade of domestic demand may run through the policy front and investment themes in the next five years. We expect long-term capital such as mutual funds and insurance funds to further tilt towards those industries of strategic value.”\\n\\nChipmakers, robotics companies, high-end manufacturers and stocks linked to domestic consumption were set to emerge as outperformers in the long run, according to brokerages including Guotai Haitong Securities and Huajin Securities.\\nIn a sign of how critical technology will be for China’s growth in the following five years, the proposal had 46 references to the word, compared with 36 in the plan for 2020-2025.\\nThe five-year plan’s importance for investors grew after this year’s bull run – which drove the Shanghai Composite Index of yuan-denominated stocks to a decade high – showed signs of petering out. A twist and turn in China-US tensions, frothy valuations of tech companies and a weak domestic economy threw the durability of the rally into doubt.\\nBeijing’s call for more tech breakthroughs and a renewed commitment to self-sufficiency should reignite enthusiasm for Chinese technology firms that have led the rally on the broader market this year, reversing years of declines. The surge in tech stocks stemmed from a re-rating triggered by the abrupt ascent of AI start-up DeepSeek earlier in the year and hopes of high-quality domestic products replacing imported products.\\n\\n\\nThe Star Market 50 index of the biggest stocks on the Shanghai exchange’s tech board, including Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corporation (SMIC) and AI chipmaker Cambricon Technologies, has gained 43 per cent this year. Meanwhile, the Hang Seng Tech Index has risen 32 per cent in the period. Both gauges have beaten the mainland and Hong Kong benchmarks.\\nSentiment this year also shifted towards Chinese tech stocks this year because Beijing ended a brutal regulatory crackdown on internet platforms that had sparked a massive exodus starting in 2020. Meanwhile, defying US curbs on exports of most advanced technologies, China is making rapid advances in the areas of robotics, AI infrastructure and large-language models as Beijing presses ahead with the self-reliance strategy.\\nThe stock market reflects the progress. The combined market capitalisation of strategic emerging industries totals 36 trillion yuan (US$5.1 trillion) currently, representing about 40 per cent of the aggregate value of the listed companies on the mainland’s three exchanges, according to Guosen Securities. Most of the companies were engaged in biopharmaceuticals, electronics and computing, it said.\\n“The bull run on tech stocks is expected to extend to 2026 or even the whole of the following five years,” said Wang Kai, an analyst at the brokerage. “The potential of Chinese tech stocks may lead global markets against the backdrop of innovation.”\\n\\n\\nGoldman Sachs said in an October 22 report that Chinese stocks could rise about 30 per cent through the end of 2027, with technology innovation sustaining earnings growth.\\nHowever, some observers were more cautious.\\nCharu Chanana, chief investment strategist at Saxo Markets, pointed to high valuations as a hindrance to further gains in Chinese tech stocks.\\nWhile the Hang Seng Tech Index was cheaper than the Nasdaq 100 on a price-to-earnings basis, its multiple of 20 times earnings was already close to the five-year average, according to Bloomberg data.\\nThe multiples for some leading companies are even more eye-watering. China’s biggest chipmaker, SMIC, was valued at 199 times estimated earnings for this year, and the ratio for Cambricon, dubbed China’s Nvidia, was 271 times, Bloomberg data showed. In comparison, the so-called Magnificent Seven US stocks, including Nvidia and Apple, currently trade at 38 times.\\n\\n\\n“In this context, policy optimism may already be priced in, leaving the next phase dependent on earnings delivery, particularly from domestic chipmakers, automation firms and AI infrastructure players capable of turning policy momentum into profits,” Chanana said.\\nUK-based asset management firm Aberdeen Investments said that it would explore opportunities arising from the green transition in the five-year plan, as it anticipated that China would double down on renewable energy.\\n“Renewable power investment is increasingly being used as a macro-stabilisation lever, which we estimate largely offset the drag from the real estate bubble being deflated over 2023 and 2024,” said Robert Gilhooly, an economist at Aberdeen. “Given the need to deal with overcapacity, we expect that power capacity, storage facilities and investment to integrate renewables into the grid will be ramped up.”\\n\\nOn top of tech innovation and self-reliance, the five-year proposal also emphasises maintaining a “reasonable” share of manufacturing in the economy, a strategy interpreted as entrenching China’s dominant position in the world’s supply chain amid geopolitical uncertainty.\\nBeijing has recently leveraged exports of rare earths – the critical metals used to make everything from weaponry to hi-tech products – in its trade talks with the US. China controls about 70 per cent of global supply and leads the world in refining and processing.\\nUnlike the preceding five-year plan through 2025, the new proposal devoted limited sections to the embattled property market and the ongoing anti-involution campaign that aims to eliminate obsolete capacity in some of the green-energy industries.\\nWhile this was a disappointment to investors who expected more policy support to alleviate these economic obstructions, Gary Dugan, CEO of The Global CIO Office, viewed the change in rhetoric as a decisive pivot to a new growth model that reduces reliance on real estate and credit.\\nWith China striving to pursue high-quality growth, key investment themes would emanate from deepening supply-side reforms, accelerating innovation in strategic sectors including semiconductors, AI and green energy, and enhancing the role of state-led investment in core infrastructure, he said.\\n“For markets, this suggests that cyclical reflation trades tied to property or broad-based stimulus will remain challenged, while targeted industrial sectors aligned with the new development plan, such as robotics, EVs and next-generation manufacturing, could continue to be the relative winners,” said Dugan, whose firm advises family offices, wealth managers and ultra-high-net-worth individuals.\\n\\nThe shift implied an annual growth rate of between 4.5 and 5 per cent in the next five-year period, compared with the current target of around 5 per cent, according to UBS Group. The Swiss bank added that China would need to strengthen the yuan and increase per capita gross domestic product by a compound annual rate of 6 to 8 per cent to meet its goal of matching developed countries in that metric by 2035.\\nFor those who bet on immediate stimulus measures, the plenum may present a short-term trading opportunity. Top leaders’ call for “resolutely” achieving this year’s economic growth target signalled a rapid ramp-up of policy support to arrest the resuming downturn, according to Nomura Holdings.\\nChina would require 4.2 per cent growth in the fourth quarter to meet its annual goal of around 5 per cent, but intensifying headwinds made reaching the target more challenging, said Lu Ting, chief China economist at the Japanese brokerage.\\nThe third quarter’s 4.8 per cent growth was mainly driven by the rising stock market and exports, which may not be sustainable, Lu said. More worrisome were a deceleration in retail sales, a decline in fixed-asset investment and the unrelenting slump in the property market, he added. Supportive measures put in place earlier, including childbirth subsidies and an increase in bond issuances by local governments, were not adequate to reverse course, he said.\\n“We reckon that after the plenum, policy focus might be once again shifted to ensuring short-term growth stability and ending deflation,” Lu said. “Fiscal expansion will likely be stepped up, policy rates could be moderately cut and arrears might be further cleared.”\\nAn easing of the China-US confrontation after the meeting between President Xi Jinping and US President Donald Trump this week may only underscore the urgency of tech innovation and self-efficiency for Beijing, as both sides are buying time for a potential decoupling. Washington signed a slew of pacts with Australia and Japan recently on rare earth access, as it aims to wean itself from reliance on China for the metals.\\nThe Xi-Trump sit-down provided “both sides with time to adapt to this evolving dynamic, reduce mutual dependencies and mitigate economic disruption”, said Sophie Altermatt, an economist at Julius Baer, the Switzerland-based financial institution that specialises in private banking and wealth management.\\n\\nHistorically, China’s stock markets react positively to the release of five-year development plans. The mainland’s yuan-traded stocks rose by an average of 16.5 per cent one year after the plenums, while key industries seen as policy beneficiaries returned 17.5 per cent on average, according to HSBC Qianhai Securities.\\nThe brokerage recommended that investors focus on stocks associated with tech innovation, consumption and the green transition.\\nThe five-year plan would “strengthen the trend of a slow bull market in the longer perspective,” said Deng Lijun, an analyst at Huajin Securities.\\n“Earnings expectations will continue to improve, and proactive policies will expand stocks’ valuations,” he said. “Risk appetite will get a boost.”\\n",
