            "description": "Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney said he told Ontario’s premier not to run an anti-tariff advertisement that prompted US President Donald Trump to end trade talks with Canada.\\nCarney also confirmed that he apologised to the president during a dinner at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit because Trump was “offended”.\\nOntario’s television advertisement that aired in the US criticises Trump’s tariffs by citing a speech from former US President Ronald Reagan.\\nThe ad infuriated Trump, who ended trade talks with Canada and said he plans to hike tariffs on imports of Canadian goods by an extra 10 per cent.\\nWhen asked on Saturday what Ontario Premier Doug Ford’s response was to being asked not to run the ad, Carney said, “Well, you saw what came of it”.\\n“It’s not something I would have done,” Carney added at a news conference as he wrapped a nine-day trip to Asia.\\nFord is a populist Conservative, while Carney is a Liberal. As premier, Ford is the equivalent of a US governor.\\n\\n“I’m the one who is responsible, in my role as prime minister, for the relationship with the president of the US, and the federal government is responsible for the foreign relationship with the US government,” Carney said.\\nA spokesperson for Ford didn’t immediately respond when asked if Carney told Ford not to run the ad.\\nFord previously said Carney and Carney’s chief of staff watched the ad before it was released.\\nFord pulled the ad last Monday but allowed it to be shown in the first two games of the baseball World Series.\\nTrump said the ad misrepresented the position of Reagan, a two-term president and a beloved figure in the Republican Party. But Reagan was wary of tariffs and used much of the 1987 address featured in Ontario’s ad, spelling out the case against them.\\nTrump has complained the ad was aimed at influencing the US Supreme Court ahead of arguments scheduled this month that could decide whether Trump has the power to impose his sweeping tariffs, a key part of his economic strategy. Lower courts had ruled he had exceeded his authority.\\n\\n\\nCarney met with Trump at the White House last month and has been trying to secure a trade deal to lower some tariffs on sectors like steel and aluminium. Tariffs are taking a toll in the aluminium, steel, auto and timber sectors.\\nMore than three-quarters of Canadian exports go to the US, and nearly 3.6 billion Canadian dollars (US$2.7 billion) worth of goods and services cross the border daily.\\n",

            "description": "Kai Tak Arena came alive on Saturday night, but a fevered home support could not prevent Hong Kong’s fast and physical opening National Games handball clash ending in defeat by Anhui.\\nAlthough the venue was still less than half full for the hosts’ match, after just a few hundred spectators had turned up to be royally entertained by the opening three games, the local side received noisy and incessant backing. The decibel levels peaked when Hong Kong drew level at 28-28 with six minutes remaining.\\nAnhui errors were cheered, and their infringements met with piercing whistles and jeers. A deathly hush descended when the province team found the net.\\nAs they finally saw off Hong Kong’s resistance by a 34-29 margin, the Anhui players celebrated demonstratively, with a couple goading the home fans.\\nKim Ekdahl Du Rietz, the city team’s head coach, said he was “happy and proud” after his team rallied following an opening half when they “showed signs of tension”.\\nThe Swede added that he had “hoped more [fans] would show up ... but those who did were fantastic”. Hong Kong face Shanghai on Sunday in a match Ekdahl Du Rietz said his side would start as 60-40 favourites. “We have to forget today and move on,” he added.\\n“In the first half, I saw players doing things they wouldn’t normally, their movements weren’t as smooth, but hopefully that’s behind us now.”\\nIn the other Group B game, Macau’s collection of “firemen, policemen and bankers” were steamrollered 40-15 by Beijing.\\nThe top four in each of two five-team groups will advance to Friday’s last-eight matches.\\nThe triumphant Beijing players ambled haughtily past the media without uttering a word, before Victor Lei Un-wai, the Macau captain, stopped to reveal that his side had been plagued by pre-match nerves.\\n“None of us can sleep at night – we have very few chances to play big games against professionals,” said Lei, whose team are making their Games debut.\\n“It’s very tough for us, it’s just a hobby, and it’s only in the past month we got our team together. I’m the only one who has a job in handball: I coach and work on the games staff. The others are bankers, policemen and firemen.\\n“We’re playing the Macau style, enjoying the games and treasuring this opportunity.”\\nJiangsu, chasing a fifth straight National Games crown, beat familiar big-match rivals Guangdong 26-22 in the day’s opening match.\\nThey had seen off the same opponents in February’s Games test event, and again in the semi-finals of their fifth straight successful national championship campaign this year.\\nIndeed, key Jiangsu man Gao Wenhan said his team had been guilty of complacency in slipping to a 12-10 half-time deficit.\\n“We’ve played them many times and always managed to be five or six points ahead going into the second half,” Gao said. “We didn’t pay enough attention.”\\nInspired by six-goal top-scorer Zhou Ao, Jiangsu roared back after the break, with a red card for Guangdong’s Yao Xueyan essentially sealing his team’s fate.\\n“We found our usual selves, with strong defence and effective counter-attacks – this is who we are,” Gao said.\\nYao’s defensive partner Zhang Jianjie said his colleague’s exclusion had an impact on the whole team. “With his height, Yao is crucial for blocking shots,” Zhang said. “He’s the backbone of our defence.”\\nIn the other Group A clash, Shaanxi overcame Tianjin 24-18.\\n",

            "title": "Will Trump’s call to resume nuclear testing fuel a US-China arms race?",
            "description": "US President Donald Trump’s call to “immediately” resume testing of nuclear weapons, citing Beijing and Moscow’s rapid nuclear build-up, could drive China to “accelerate” its own efforts to develop its strategic forces, according to analysts.\\nOn Thursday, Trump posted on social media that he had instructed the Pentagon to start testing US nuclear weapons “on an equal basis” with Russia and China because of “other countries’ testing programmes”.\\n“That process will begin immediately,” Trump said in a post published just a few minutes before his meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping in Busan, South Korea, on the sidelines of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (Apec) summit.\\nTrump said that while the US had more nuclear weapons than any other country – followed by Russia in second place and China as a “distant” third – Moscow and Beijing’s nuclear forces would catch up with Washington within five years.\\nIn response to Trump’s order, the United Nations issued a rare direct rebuke.\\n“We shouldn’t forget the disastrous legacy of over 2,000 nuclear-weapons tests that have been carried out over the last 80 years,” UN spokesman Farhan Haq told reporters on Thursday. He said the UN and Secretary General Antonio Guterres believed “nuclear testing can never be permitted under any circumstances”.\\nThe US conducted its last nuclear test in 1992, the same year George H.W. Bush, US president at the time, issued a moratorium on nuclear tests.\\nIn 1996, the multilateral Comprehensive Nuclear-Test Ban Treaty was adopted by the UN General Assembly. The US, China and Russia signed the treaty that year but did not ratify it. While Russia then ratified the treaty in 2000, Russian President Vladimir Putin revoked the ratification in 2023.\\n\\n\\nTrump did not specify which nuclear weapons tests should resume.\\nTimothy Heath, a senior international defence researcher at the US-based Rand Corporation, said Trump might have been referring to missile test launches, which could be used to deliver nuclear weapons.\\n“Russia and China have done such missile launches for ballistic, hypersonic, and cruise missiles, some of which could deliver nuclear weapons,” Heath said.\\n“Maybe Trump wants to detonate a nuclear weapon to test it. However, this would represent a striking change from recent years ... In short, it’s not clear what sort of tests Trump had in mind.”\\nTong Zhao, a senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, said China would “need time to assess what policy changes may follow” Trump’s order.\\nZhao said at the strategic level, Trump’s threat to resume nuclear testing could partly be intended to “pressure China to curb its rapid nuclear build-up and join arms control negotiations”.\\n“However, given Beijing’s strong commitment to ‘strengthening and enlarging’ its nuclear arsenal – recently reaffirmed at the fourth plenum of the [Communist Party Central Committee] – China is unlikely to slow its pace,” Zhao said.\\n“On the contrary, the threat may prompt Beijing to accelerate preparations to resume nuclear explosive testing, if not double down on its broader nuclear modernisation and expansion efforts.”\\nHe said Trump’s “unexpected” post might have been triggered by Russia’s back-to-back testing of two new types of exotic nuclear weapon delivery systems over the past few days, with Trump’s remark a likely reference to the US starting to develop similar technology.\\nPutin announced this week that his country had tested a new long-range nuclear-powered underwater weapon as well as a nuclear-powered and nuclear-capable cruise missile.\\n“Consequently, there would be a significant likelihood that Beijing would follow suit. China has reportedly already engaged in research on new and nontraditional nuclear delivery technologies,” Zhao said.\\n“Continued Russian progress in this field, combined with parallel US efforts, could further motivate China to accelerate its own research programme to avoid falling behind.”\\nHeath said Trump’s instructions might have been made with Beijing’s nuclear capabilities in mind.\\n“China is rapidly expanding its inventory, and Russia has shown that it is still developing new missiles and underwater systems to deliver nuclear weapons,” Heath said. “The US will probably follow this trend in modernising its nuclear forces as well.”\\nHeath said that the nuclear arms build-up was not just accelerating because of Trump’s comments.\\nBeijing pledged to “strengthen strategic deterrence capabilities, [and] safeguard global strategic balance and stability” as part of its proposed blueprint for the 15th five-year plan, which was endorsed last week by the party’s Central Committee and will cover the years 2026-2030. The Chinese government often uses the phrase “strategic deterrence” to refer to nuclear forces.\\nAccording to a June report by the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI), China has added 100 warheads to its nuclear stockpile each year since 2023, making it the “fastest growing nuclear arsenal in the world”.\\nThe SIPRI report estimated that China held at least 600 warheads, which was expected to “keep growing over the coming decade”, while the US had a total inventory of 5,177 warheads, of which 3,700 were in military stockpiles. Meanwhile, Russia had 5,459 warheads, of which 4,309 were in military stockpiles, it said.\\nAccording to a Pentagon report on China’s military development, China is projected to reach around 1,000 warheads by 2030.\\nWhile China’s last known nuclear test took place in 1996, it has continued to test nuclear-capable missiles, such as intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBM) and hypersonic missiles.\\nThe Trump administration has tried to add China to discussions to extend the New Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (New Start). The treaty was signed between Washington and Moscow in 2010 and capped the number of deployed strategic nuclear warheads on ICBMs and delivery systems to 1,550. It will expire in February next year.\\nBeijing has rejected the idea, and the issue did not come up in the Xi-Trump summit on Thursday.\\n",

            "description": "Israel said on Saturday that three bodies it received from Gaza the night before were not hostages held in the Palestinian territory, as a Hamas security source reported fresh strikes in the south.\\nDespite occasional flare-ups, a fragile truce has been holding in Gaza since October 10, based on a US-brokered deal centred on the return of all Israeli hostages, both living and dead.\\nIsrael’s military said that a forensic analysis revealed that three bodies it received via the Red Cross on Friday were not those of the deceased captives still to be handed over as part of the ceasefire deal.\\nA second Israeli military official confirmed on Saturday that they were not aware of any hostages, followed by the office of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.\\n“The remains we received are not our hostages,” the office said.\\nIt was unclear who they might be and why they were returned to Israel. The two Israeli officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorised to talk to the media.\\nHamas’s armed wing said on Saturday that it had handed over bodies it had not positively identified, alleging Israel had declined its offer to provide samples for testing and “demanded the bodies for examination”.\\n“We handed them over to pre-empt any enemy claims,” the Ezzedine Al-Qassam Brigades said.\\nAfter the start of the truce, Hamas returned the 20 surviving hostages still in its custody and began the process of returning the remains of the dead.\\nOf the 17 bodies returned since the start of the ceasefire, 15 were Israelis, one was Thai and one was Nepalese.\\nHamas has also returned another unidentified body that had not been listed among the 28 missing, as well as the partial remains of a deceased Israeli hostage who had already been recovered early in the war.\\nThat incident drew outrage in Israel, which said the group had violated the agreement by returning the partial remains rather than the body of another hostage.\\nIsrael has accused Hamas of not returning the dead hostages quickly enough, but the Palestinian group says it will take time to locate remains buried in Gaza’s ruins.\\nIn its statement Saturday, the Al-Qassam Brigades called on mediators and the Red Cross to provide the “necessary equipment and personnel to work on recovering all the bodies simultaneously”.\\nThe remains of the three people handed over by Hamas followed Israel’s return on Friday of the bodies of 30 Palestinians to Gaza.\\nThe total number of Palestinian bodies returned by Israel since the ceasefire began now stands at 225. Only 75 of those have been identified by families, according to Gaza’s Health Ministry.\\nIt is unclear if those returned were killed in Israel during the October 7, 2023 attack, whether they died in Israeli custody as detainees or were recovered from Gaza by troops during the war.\\n\\nWarships opened fire\\nHamas and Israel, meanwhile, have traded accusations of breaking the ceasefire.\\nA Hamas security source said on Saturday that Israel had carried out several air strikes in the south at dawn, and that “warships opened fire toward the shores of Khan Younis”.\\nEarlier in the week, the Israeli military launched its deadliest night of bombing since the truce after one of its soldiers was killed in south Gaza, with the territory’s civil defence agency reporting more than 100 people killed.\\nHamas denied it had anything to do with the attack, and Israel later said it had begun “renewed enforcement of the ceasefire”.\\nFather-of-five Hisham al-Bardai, who recently returned to his home in north Gaza’s Jabalia camp, said on Saturday that he had heard “gunfire several times from the occupation forces” during the night.\\n“The truce has begun, but the war hasn’t ended, and [Israel’s] policy of starvation continues,” he said, referring to Israel’s strict blockade on the entry of supplies into Gaza, which it eased after the ceasefire went into effect.\\nLike many Gazans who moved back to neighbourhoods previously under evacuation orders, Bardai found a collapsed building where his home once stood.\\n“Despite the widespread destruction in Jabalia camp, people are starting to return, even though the situation is dangerous,” the 37-year-old said.\\n\\n‘No hope for life’\\nThe implementation of the later stages of US President Donald Trump’s ceasefire plan has yet to be agreed, particularly as it concerns disarming Hamas, establishing a transitional authority and deploying an international stabilisation force.\\nThe force is expected to be drawn from a coalition of mainly Arab and Muslim nations, and would train and support vetted Palestinian police, with backing from Egypt and Jordan, as well as secure border areas and prevent weapons smuggling.\\nThe foreign ministers of Jordan and Germany insisted on Saturday at a conference in Bahrain that the international force have the blessing of the United Nations.\\n“We all agree that in order for that stabilisation force to be able to be effective in getting the job done, it has to have a Security Council mandate,” Jordanian Foreign Minister Ayman Safadi said.\\nHis German counterpart Johann Wadephul said such a mandate would be of the “utmost importance to those countries who might be willing to send troops to Gaza, and for the Palestinians”.\\nMany Gazans remain displaced and living in tents or makeshift shelters.\\nSumaya Daloul, a 27-year-old living in a tent with her parents and siblings in Gaza City, said she did not have much hope for the future.\\n“I expect the suffering in Gaza to continue for years.

            "description": "China’s decision to host next year’s Apec summit in the innovation hub of Shenzhen reflects Beijing’s “resolve to uphold openness”, according to analysts.\\nHighlighting the southern city’s spectacular growth over the past few decades, Chinese President Xi Jinping announced the decision at the end of the 2025 Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (Apec) summit in Gyeongju, South Korea, on Saturday.\\n“Located on the Pacific coast and adjacent to Hong Kong, Shenzhen has transformed from a backward fishing village into a modern international metropolis in just a few decades,” Xi said.\\n“Together with surrounding areas, it forms the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macau Greater Bay Area, which can be considered a growth pole of the world economy.”\\n\\n\\nAnalysts said China’s choice of Shenzhen as the host city reflected various considerations, including the desire to highlight the country’s gains in economic development.\\nZhu Feng, executive dean of Nanjing University’s school of international studies, described Shenzhen as “a landmark city symbolising China’s economic integration with the world”.\\nSelecting Shenzhen would demonstrate to the world “the alignment and integration of China’s economic development with the global economy following reform and opening up”, Zhu said.\\nThe message could be amplified if US President Donald Trump decides to attend the gathering.\\nDuring talks before the Apec summit on Thursday, Xi and Trump extended invitations for reciprocal state visits.\\nState news agency Xinhua also quoted Trump as saying that the United States would be happy to see the success of both next year’s Apec meeting in China and the G20 summit in Miami.\\nZhu said that if there was frequent high-level dialogue between the two countries next year, “the likelihood of Trump attending a summit in Shenzhen is considerable”.\\nIn that case, the Shenzhen summit would serve as “a significant diplomatic opportunity to further strengthen the strategic relationship between the two nations’ leaders”, he said.\\nZhu added that a summit in Shenzhen could also provide “a crucial diplomatic occasion for further integration into the global and Western spheres” for US-sanctioned enterprises, including telecommunications giant Huawei Technologies, which is headquartered in the city.\\nThis would also enable China to “further reduce the excessive focus on security in US-China relations”, according to Zhu.\\n\\n\\nShenzhen has grown exponentially from its fishing village roots more than four decades ago to become a city of nearly 18 million people.\\nIt is also one of China’s leading centres for hi-tech innovation, including artificial intelligence and other areas of strict competition with the US.\\nBut while it is China’s “most successful special economic zone”, it simultaneously “endures the most severe blows from trade protectionism and technological decoupling”, according to Peng Peng, executive chairman of the Guangdong Society of Reform, a think tank affiliated with the Guangdong provincial government.\\nAccording to Peng, selecting Shenzhen as the Apec host city demonstrated China’s “resolve to uphold openness and continue guiding the direction of globalisation”.\\nFurthermore, a summit in Shenzhen would enable “the world, particularly major nations, to gain a comprehensive and in-depth understanding of the Greater Bay Area’s development progress and overall strength”.\\nShenzhen is one of nine cities in Guangdong that make up the Greater Bay Area, which also includes the special administrative regions of Hong Kong and Macau.\\nIn recent years, Beijing has sought to transform the Greater Bay Area into a world-class economic and innovation hub.\\nHong Kong Chief Executive John Lee Ka-chiu said the announcement about Shenzhen made him feel “motivated”, and the city would do its best to support the Apec meeting next year.\\n“We are thrilled … Shenzhen is our close neighbour. Our relationship is very close,” he said.\\n“The Hong Kong government is fully prepared and will be very excited to be able to support the organisation and success of the Apec conference.”\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPeng said Hong Kong could be the first stop for some Apec leaders on their way to the summit, given that Hong Kong operated more international flight routes than Shenzhen.\\nHe said the provincial capital Guangzhou, which hosts a number of consulates, could also feature on leaders’ itineraries.\\nThe overall effects would be “positive and beneficial” but it was difficult now to “comprehensively assess the spillover effects” of the Apec summit on other cities in the Greater Bay Area, including Hong Kong, he said.\\nIn recent years, China has selected lesser-known cities to host multilateral diplomatic events, aiming to boost their international profile.\\nFor example, the northern port city of Tianjin hosted the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation summit earlier this year while the coastal city of Qingdao was the backdrop for the bloc’s gathering in 2018.\\nOther cases include the 2016 G20 summit in the eastern city of Hangzhou, the 2017 Brics summit in the southeastern coastal city of Xiamen, and the 2023 China-Central Asia Summit in western city of Xian.\\nShenzhen will be the third Chinese city to host the Apec meeting – Shanghai hosted in 2001 and Beijing in 2014.\\nOn Friday, Xi called on world leaders to uphold multilateralism and ensure supply chain stability.\\nIn a separate address on Saturday, the Chinese leader warned of intensifying challenges such as climate change and energy security, calling on regional economies to deepen cooperation and “seize new opportunities”.\\nXi said countries should promote the “sound and orderly development of artificial intelligence while ensuring that it is beneficial, safe and fair”.\\nXi arrived in South Korea on Thursday and held talks with various world leaders on the sidelines of the forum.\\nThese included South Korean President Lee Jae-myung, Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney, Japanese Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi and Thai Prime Minister Anutin Charnvirakul.\\nSeparately, Apec member states wrapped up the two-day summit with a joint declaration, pledging to strengthen economic cooperation to navigate the changing global conditions.\\nThe declaration warned that the Asia-Pacific region stood at a “pivotal juncture” and acknowledged that “the global trading system continues to face significant challenges”.\\n“We reaffirm our shared recognition that robust trade and investment are vital to the growth and prosperity of the Asia-Pacific region, and remain committed to deepening economic cooperation to navigate the evolving global environment,” it said.\\n“We acknowledge the importance of a trade and investment environment that promotes resilience and benefits for all.”\\nThe declaration also called for efforts to ensure the resilience of supply chains, and urged cooperation in AI as well as coordination to respond to global challenges including in areas of energy and food security.\\nAdditional reporting by Willa Wu\\n",

            "description": "The news that Hong Kong would co-host China’s National Games for the first time, a landmark for the city, was not accompanied by the fanfare that might have been expected when it was announced four years ago.\\nAt the time, the world was still in the grip of the pandemic. Hong Kong’s measures to combat Covid-19, including quarantine and strict social-distancing rules, hit the city’s sports sector hard.\\nIconic events such as the rugby sevens, the marathon and Oxfam Trailwalker were cancelled or scaled down. International competitions moved elsewhere. Sports venues, leagues and gyms closed.\\nThere was, for a time, even a requirement that masks be worn while exercising outdoors. Ever tried running in a mask? I wouldn’t recommend it. Some teams resorted to training sessions via Zoom.\\nThis was a desperate time for Hong Kong sport, with elite athletes and emerging talent deprived of much-needed opportunities to develop.\\nIt was difficult to imagine the city would, even by 2025, be simultaneously hosting multiple sports events watched by tens of thousands of cheering fans, anticipating a haul of medals.\\nThat is why the National Games are important. They are a defining moment in Hong Kong’s post-pandemic recovery.\\nToday’s torch relay through the city’s streets and across the harbour to the new Kai Tak Stadium is a prelude to next Sunday’s opening ceremony in Guangzhou.\\nBut the action is already under way, with beach volleyball at Victoria Park and men’s handball in the Kai Tak Arena.\\nThe show, so far, has been stolen by Nicholas Halliday, who won Hong Kong’s first gold medal last week in a sailing event in Shanwei.\\nIt is, hopefully, the first of many as the city seeks to continue an unexpected winning streak that has helped transform perceptions of sport in Hong Kong and elevate its status.\\nThe government is pumping more money into the sector and an increasing number of elite international competitions are being hosted. Success, it is hoped, will breed success.\\nMomentum started to build shortly before the 2021 announcement that Hong Kong would host the National Games, along with Guangdong and Macau. The city’s performance in the Tokyo summer Olympics that year exceeded expectations.\\nSix medals were won, including a gold for fencer Cheung Ka-long, only the second ever secured by Hong Kong. The surprise success came as a welcome distraction from the pandemic deprivations and political changes of the time.\\nThe medal-winning feats also highlighted what should have been obvious long ago, that sport in the city has great potential – a healthy pursuit, a source of pride and togetherness, a means of improving Hong Kong’s international ties and boosting its economy. It should be a priority.\\nTokyo, it turned out, was just the start. Cheung struck gold again in the Paris Olympics last summer, as did fellow fencer Vivian Kong Man-wai. Swimmer Siobhan Haughey also did the city proud, winning two bronze.\\nHong Kong collected a record haul of medals in the Asian Games in 2023, in sports ranging from cycling to rowing, wushu, athletics and golf. The team returned with eight golds.\\nThere have been more recent achievements, too. Fencer Ryan Choi Chun-yin became the city’s first world champion in July. Tennis player Coleman Wong Chak-lam also made history, reaching the third round of the New York Open in September. And the city’s men’s rugby team have qualified for the World Cup finals for the first time.\\nIt is encouraging that Hong Kong’s young athletes are also performing well. They wrapped up the Asian Youth Games last week with 36 medals, another record, with swimmers leading the way.\\nBut to establish itself as a leading centre for sport – it was ranked 50 in the world this year – the city needs more than good performances. The ability to regularly host elite international events is essential.\\nThe opening of Kai Tak Sports Park in March, with its 50,000-seat stadium, has been described as a game changer, making it much easier to attract top teams and tournaments.\\nA “football festival” featuring famous clubs from England and Italy drew big crowds there in July. Similar high-profile visits are in the pipeline.\\nSnooker, fencing, tennis, golf and table-tennis are among the sports that have chosen Hong Kong for major competitions. The days of pandemic-era isolation are long gone.\\nBut the National Games will pose unprecedented challenges. Hong Kong has wanted to be a co-host ever since returning to China in 1997, first expressing an interest in the 2001 event.\\nThe competition, between teams from across China, will be fierce. There are more than 400 events in 34 sports to be held at 11 Greater Bay Area cities until November 21.\\nHong Kong is hosting eight sports at seven venues. Highlights will include rugby sevens at Kai Tak Stadium, fencing at Kai Tak Arena, and track cycling at the Velodrome, as well as the cross-border marathon and road cycling races.\\nThe city hosted equestrian events for the Beijing Olympics in 2008 and the East Asian Games the following year. But the stakes are even higher for the National Games, considered a source of national pride.\\nMore than 4,000 athletes, officials and media representatives from the mainland need to be suitably accommodated and 100,000 tourists are expected. The city cannot afford anything other than a flawless execution.\\nHong Kong has not always embraced sport so enthusiastically. Parents tend to see academic success as more important and a sports culture has been slow to develop. This needs to change.\\nThe government appears to have woken up to the benefits sport can bring. Beijing, meanwhile, has identified the sector as a key driver of the economy, hoping to double the size of it by 2030.\\nDevelopments in Hong Kong include a much-needed shake-up of the sports associations, some of which operate like private clubs or fiefdoms. Moves intended to bring better corporate governance, inject younger blood and improve areas such as team selection have been put in place. They must be vigorously pursued.\\nHong Kong will need better coaching, training and facilities, as well as stronger support for its emerging and elite athletes if it is to build on what has already been achieved. The city has big ambitions. There is even talk of it bidding to co-host the Olympics along with other Greater Bay Area cities.\\nThe National Games will, if successful both in terms of hosting and performance, mark a significant step forward. But the transformation of the city’s sports scene is a marathon and the finishing line remains a long way away.\\n",

            "description": "Hong Kong reported two imported cases of chikungunya on Saturday, both of whom were hospitalised and are now in stable condition, bringing the total number of cases this year to 54, according to health authorities.\\nThe first case involved a 32-year-old woman living in Sha Tin who had travelled to India between October 9 and 23. She developed a rash and joint pain on the last day of her trip, followed by a fever the next day.\\nShe first consulted a private doctor on October 29 and later went to the accident and emergency department at Prince of Wales Hospital in Sha Tin, where she was admitted the same day and had been receiving treatment in a mosquito-free environment, the Department of Health said.\\nThe second patient is a 32-year-old man who travelled to Macau and Zhuhai with three family members between October 4 and 5. He developed a fever on October 28, followed by a skin rash and significant joint pain in his hands and feet the next day.\\nThe Central and Western district resident first sought medical help at a private hospital and was later admitted to Queen Mary Hospital on Friday, where he is also being treated in a mosquito-free environment.\\n\\n“Although the incubation period for chikungunya fever is generally within two weeks, some infected individuals may experience very mild initial symptoms that go unnoticed,” a government spokesman said, noting that the patient had travelled to an area affected by chikungunya fever about three weeks before the onset of symptoms.\\nThe spokesman added that the patient had not visited the area around Fung Tak Estate in Wong Tai Sin after returning to Hong Kong, where a local case had been detected, and that this was why the possibility of overseas infection was not ruled out.\\nOf the 54 recorded cases of chikungunya so far this year, 52 were imported, with the rest locally acquired. No additional local cases had been detected in the city as of 5pm on Saturday, the government said.\\nMore than 40 countries and regions have reported more than 400,000 cases and 155 deaths this year up to September 30, with infections spread across the Americas, Africa, Asia and Europe. The government stressed that the fatality rate remains below 0.1 per cent.\\nThose aged over 65, infants under one year old, pregnant women and people with chronic illnesses may take longer to recover from chikungunya and could develop complications.\\nThe government urged anyone who developed symptoms – particularly fever, joint pain or rashes – after visiting areas affected by the virus to seek medical advice promptly.\\n",

            "description": "Rare earths will remain an “important card” for China in its relations with the United States, despite the Group of Seven’s commitment to challenge Beijing’s dominance of the critical minerals, according to a Chinese observer.\\nAt a meeting in the Canadian city of Toronto on Friday, G7 energy ministers agreed to establish a critical minerals production alliance.\\nThe plans include more than two dozen new investments, partnerships and measures to accelerate and unlock C$6.4 billion (US$4.57 billion) in critical mineral projects, according to the government department Natural Resources Canada.\\nThe group – which consists of Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom and the United States – also agreed to channel up to C$20.2 million into international collaboration in research and development of the commodities.\\nThese moves “send the world a very clear message”, Canadian Energy Minister Tim Hodgson said, according to Agence France-Presse.\\n“We are serious about reducing market concentration and dependencies,” Hodgson said, referring to China.\\nChina dominates the world’s supply of rare earths, controlling up to 70 per cent of global extraction of the minerals, roughly 85 per cent of refining capacity and about 90 per cent of rare earths metal alloy and magnet production, according to Reuters, citing data from consultancy AlixPartners.\\nOn October 9, China announced fresh restrictions on rare earth exports, adding five more elements to the control list and expanding licensing requirements to cover technologies for mining, processing and manufacturing.\\nThose controls were due to take effect on November 1 but China suspended them for a year following a summit between Chinese President Xi Jinping and his US counterpart Donald Trump on Thursday.\\nAfter the summit, Trump said there was “no roadblock at all” on rare earths.\\n\\n\\nBut before the meeting in Toronto, US Energy Secretary Chris Wright said the Trump administration was fully aligned with the G7 allies on countering China’s market influence.\\nWright accused China of using non-market practices to “squish the rest of the world out of manufacturing those products” to gain strategic leverage.\\n“We need to establish our own ability to mine, process, refine and create the products that come out of rare earth elements,” he said.\\n“We’re going to have to intervene and use some non-market forces.”\\n\\n\\nHowever, Wu Xinbo, dean of Fudan University’s Institute of International Studies, downplayed the threat of that intervention.\\nWu said the non-market strategy – including tariffs, technology suppression, sanctions and export controls – was not new and could be traced back to the Trump administration’s first term.\\n“[The G7] has long wanted to break free from the reliance on Chinese rare earths, but in reality, they can’t do it,” Wu said.\\n“Therefore, I believe that neither market- nor non-market strategies will be successful in the foreseeable future … Rare earths will remain a very important card for China in China-US relations. We have confidence in this.”\\nZhu Feng, executive dean of Nanjing University’s school of international studies, said the G7 summit sent a clear message about the US’ position.\\n“While China and the US have reached a temporary compromise on the trade war now, it is not over and the China-US trade agreement has not yet been officially signed,” Zhu said.\\nHe said that for now the US was seeking to avoid the short-term shock of the ban on the Western industrial system.\\n“The long-term goal is to break free from reliance on China’s rare earth supply chain and value chain. This remains a central component of the strategic competition between China and the US,” Zhu added.\\nHe cautioned that China was naturally concerned about the G7’s plan, as supply chains should be open, diversified and oriented towards market competition.\\n“Allowing geopolitical factors to hijack supply chains will only lead to regression and fragmentation,” Zhu said.\\n",
