            "title": "Has a China-Argentina radio telescope been delayed by US political pressure?",
            "description": "A cutting-edge radio telescope built through a long-term partnership between China and Argentina was due to begin peering into the heavens in a few months, but the project is instead staring at lengthy delays – mired in political friction between Beijing and Washington.\\nPerched at the top of a mountain, the China-Argentina Radio Telescope (CART) has been described as a celestial “lighthouse” for Earth’s southern sky. Once operational, the largest single dish telescope in Latin America is expected to reveal new insights about stellar formations, objects such as pulsars and the distant centre of our galaxy.\\nHowever, construction which was set to be completed by next March has been delayed since June after an international agreement was not renewed, leaving components shipped from China held up by Argentine customs.\\nMarcelo Segura, project manager of CART at the National Science and Technical Research Council (CONICET), told the South China Morning Post that the council had stopped supporting the project.\\n“This has given us problems accessing the cargo that has been retained by Argentine customs since September 3,” Segura said.\\n“As a result, we have been unable to assemble the remaining pieces. Everything is hanging by a thread,” said the electric engineer, who has been working on the CART project since 2015.\\n“We have not received any official communication. There is a national government alignment with the United States which reportedly opposes the proliferation of such projects involving Chinese facilities in our country.”\\n\\nSegura is also an associate professor in the electronics department at the National University of San Juan.\\nIn 2012, China and Argentina signed an AR$340 million (US$229,000) agreement to collaborate on the telescope to study electromagnetic radiation emitted by celestial bodies.\\n“Because it is a large-scale project, it would have been optimal for CONICET to be part of it. That way, other science institutions, such as the Argentine Institute of Radio Astronomy or the Large Latin American Millimetre Array, could cooperate,” Segura said.\\nSegura said project officials were hoping for clarity at a meeting set for November 5.\\n“We expect a solution to be discussed at a meeting between Argentine customs and the National University of San Juan. It will be decided there what will happen with the pieces retained,” he said. “There is no justification for the hold-up. We can do nothing until then.”\\nThe Post has contacted Argentina’s foreign ministry, the US embassy in Buenos Aires and CONICET for comment.\\nSegura said the radio telescope was “50 to 60 per cent complete”, with “about 80 per cent” of the assembly finished. Additional receivers were needed to complete the installation.\\n\\n\\n“Now, at least, we have two more months of delay … If we received parts tomorrow, [completion] could be in April or May,” he said.\\nWith a diameter of 40 metres (131 feet), the radio telescope would contribute to the global Very Long Baseline Interferometry, a network of radio telescopes that observes cosmic radio sources in very high angular resolution.\\nIt is designed to function as a versatile “lighthouse” to measure distances, processes and magnetic fields in stellar formations and detect interstellar objects such as pulsars.\\nAccording to an article published by the Argentine Astronomy Association in February: “CART can contribute to pulsar timing, regional line surveys of the major star forming regions, the Magellanic Clouds, the galactic centre and supernova remnants in the southern sky, investigations of planets and comets, and also follow up observations of gamma ray bursts, gravitational waves and other transient phenomena such as fast radio bursts.”\\nThe article was written by Li Jinzeng, a scientist who is part of the CART joint project and head of a collaboration group at the National Astronomical Observatories under the Chinese Academy of Sciences.\\nSegura said CART “was intended for geodesy” – the study of Earth’s shape, dimensions and gravitational field – and was not designed to track satellites.\\n“It is technically impossible for a radio telescope like this to track a satellite, given the speed of both the instrument and the satellite. It simply cannot move fast enough,” he said. “These are technical facts that are very important, but unfortunately not taken into account by those who decide.”\\nEzequiel Zubieta, a PhD student in astronomy at the National University of La Plata, who works on pulsar monitoring at the Argentine Institute of Radio Astronomy under CONICET, agreed that CART could play an important role in the study of geodesy.\\n“It could contribute to global networks, maintain the international celestial reference system by defining coordinates of distant objects, and improve the international land reference system in the southern hemisphere,” he said.\\nSegura said CART could be incorporated into the upper bands of radio astronomy to study radiation in space among other tasks. “Our location, which has low electromagnetic noise and clear skies, allows us to host these kinds of astronomical devices.”\\nLocated in the Felix Aguilar Observatory, the thinner atmosphere at an altitude of 2,400 metres (7,874 feet) will enable CART to receive clearer signals from space.\\nThe site offers exceptional atmospheric stability, low humidity and minimal electromagnetic interference, making it ideal for astronomical research.\\n\\nThe telescope agreement was originally signed by the National University of San Juan, the National Astronomical Observatories of China, CONICET and the government of San Juan in 2015, and has been backed by the International Astronomical Union and the Argentine Astronomy Association.\\n“There is an entire scientific community interested in seeing this project move forward,” Segura said.\\nChina and Argentina have been collaborating on astronomy since 1989, when they agreed to install an automated photo astrolabe used for making highly accurate observations of celestial bodies.\\n“There was also a 30-year cooperation agreement with China that gave it momentum,” Segura said.\\n“This new radio telescope will complement [the satellite laser] and allow us to have better resolution,” Segura said, referring to a previous project with China called the Satellite Laser Ranging System.\\nChina is home to the world’s largest, most sensitive single-dish radio telescope – the Five-hundred-metre Aperture Spherical Telescope (FAST) – located in the southwestern province of Guizhou.\\nFAST, situated in the northern hemisphere, and CART in the southern hemisphere could complement each other by conducting similar tasks in different wavelengths. FAST operates between 70 megahertz and 3 gigahertz, while CART runs between 1 and 45 gigahertz.\\nCART could also complement the Atacama Large Millimetre Array, located in Chile.\\nThis interferometer, comprising 66 dishes, operates at similar latitudes to CART but uses higher frequencies, allowing it to detect hot gases and magnetic fields.\\n",

            "title": "EU welcomes pause in rare earth controls as US-China deal overshadows Brussels talks",
            "description": "The European Union welcomed China’s suspension of expanded rare earth restrictions imposed last month, even as crisis talks in Brussels on Friday appeared to yield no relief for European firms still constrained by the original export controls.\\nAfter a full day of talks in the Belgian capital, the European Commission described the pause in controls – announced following US-China talks in South Korea on Thursday – as an “appropriate and responsible step in the context of ensuring stable global trade flows in a critically important area”.\\nCommission spokesman Olof Gill said on Saturday that the sides had “discussed how to maintain supply chain stability in relation to rare earths and committed to further engage on licensing facilitation measures, including general licences”.\\nBut with a string of breakthroughs from Thursday’s summit between Chinese and US leaders already shaping the global trade landscape and Europe’s place in it, the Brussels talks appeared little more than a sideshow.\\nEarlier on Saturday, Beijing announced that it would consider removing export controls on the Netherlands-based semiconductor maker Nexperia. The controls were imposed after the Dutch government effectively seized control of the Chinese-owned company on September 30.\\nMedia reports, meanwhile, suggested that the White House was preparing to announce that the Dutch arm of Nexperia would resume sending chips to its Chinese processing and testing facility in Dongguan. The move would be welcomed by the global automotive industry, which warned of production shutdowns if supplies remained halted.\\nMilan Captein, spokesman for the Dutch ministry of economic affairs, declined to comment on the reports but said the ministry was working with Chinese authorities and international partners towards a “constructive resolution that restores balance to the chip supply chain”.\\nAfter Chinese President Xi Jinping’s 100-minute summit with US President Donald Trump in Busan, Beijing’s commerce ministry confirmed that an expansion of the rare earth export controls announced on October 9 would be paused. In exchange, the US ceased an expansion of its blacklist of Chinese companies that would cover subsidiaries 50 per cent owned by listed entities for the same period.\\nSpeaking to reporters in Rome on Friday, EU trade chief Maros Sefcovic confirmed that the pause would benefit Europe, too.\\n“My understanding is that the agreement, which was found between the US and China in this matter, is ‘erga omnes’, so we should apply it to all and, of course, including the European Union,” he said, according to Agence France-Presse.\\nSefcovic added that he would speak to Chinese Commerce Minister Wang Wentao “very, very soon”.\\n\\n\\nNonetheless, Beijing’s restrictions dating back to April, which require companies to obtain licences before exporting rare earths, remain in place and have roiled EU industries. Since August, European companies have complained that some production has been halted over a shortage of rare earths, which are vital to many areas of advanced manufacturing.\\nThe twin developments on rare earths and Nexperia underscored that Washington and Beijing remain the ultimate arbiters of the global trade dispute and emphasised Europe’s uncomfortable position, sandwiched between the two giants.\\nInside the commission, discussions are ongoing about a new trade rule that could force some Chinese exporters to provide rare earths and other critical materials when they ship goods to Europe. Simultaneously, officials are discussing whether to weaponise Europe’s own export chokepoints to unpick Beijing’s controls.\\nThe plans, first reported on Friday by Bloomberg, are all in embryonic form, with multiple proposals circulating among European commissioners’ cabinets, according to sources. There is uncertainty as to whether an entirely new trade instrument is required.\\nHowever, this could eat up months, if not years – a time frame that emphasises how the EU’s legalistic approach jars with the US and China’s more muscular and often lightning-fast approach to weaponised trade.\\nOn Friday, EU digital chief Henna Virkkunen held meetings with Nexperia representatives, after which she affirmed that the bloc was hoping to secure a negotiated solution to the crisis. In her statements, there was no suggestion that the Busan talks would deliver a potential resolution.\\n“I reaffirmed our determination to work towards a diplomatic breakthrough. We discussed potential short- and medium-term measures to strengthen the resilience of our supply chain,” Virkkunen said.\\nWhile the Dutch government insists it was not acting under duress when it moved to ring-fence Nexperia from its Chinese owners, court documents showed that the US pressured The Hague to change the company’s management or else face being added to the expanded entity list.\\n“We know that all parties to this dispute are working very hard to find a diplomatic solution. At the same time, our members are telling us that part supplies are already being stopped due to the shortage,” said Sigrid de Vries, director general of the European Automobile Manufacturers’ Association, on Wednesday.\\n“This means assembly line stoppages might only be days away. We urge all involved to redouble their efforts to find a diplomatic way out of this critical situation.”\\n",

            "description": "Tom McKibbin’s seemingly inevitable march to the Link Hong Kong Open title hit an MJ Maguire-sized speed bump on Saturday, and a shoot-out now beckons for the spoils that will go to the victor.\\nAhead since the start of the tournament, the Northern Irishman’s cushion is down to a shot, after his second successive 65 was more than matched by Maguire’s nine-under-par 61, which moved him to 19 under for the tournament.\\nPeter Uihlein is a stroke further back in third, while the evergreen Scott Hend, who won at Hong Kong Golf Club in 2014, and Kiradech Aphibarnrat round out the top five on 17 under after carding 64 and 66 respectively.\\nAll are chasing the green-and-gold pot at the end of the rainbow, with a spot in next year’s Masters and the 154th Open Championship up for grabs alongside the US$360,000 (HK$2.8 million) first prize.\\n\\n“Everyone came here knowing the spots were available, and there’s no big deal in finishing second or third,” McKibbin said. “I came here with the mindset of just trying to give it a good go, and hopefully I can do that tomorrow.”\\nMaguire, meanwhile, was going steadily along at three under until he punched an eight iron out from among some trees on the par-four 11th and it rolled in for an eagle. Four birdies in his closing seven holes dragged him into a conversation he had not been part of for the first two days.\\nVictory on Sunday would probably lift the American into the top five in the International Series Rankings, adding an extra layer of pressure to his final round.\\n“There’s definitely a lot to play for,” Maguire said. “So I’ll just try and play it one shot at a time and stay focused.”\\nFurther down the field, and not for the first time in his career, Jason Hak Shun-yat will be Hong Kong’s lone representative on the final day of his home Open.\\nThe 31-year-old’s two-under 68 in the third round took him to seven under overall, and it could have been better if not for the bogey on 18 when a putt he thought was going left broke right instead.\\n“I think it’s one of the lowest cut lines [four under] that I’ve played,” Hak said. “There are a lot of great players, there are major champions, Ryder Cup players, and I feel good to compete with some of the best.”\\nHak will be back at Fanling again in two weeks for the National Games, although then his only focus will be helping the team win. Rules dictate that only two of the four-man squad can compete for individual glory, and this time that will be Taichi Kho and Matthew Cheung.\\nAlready the owner of a team silver medal from the 2013 Games, and with a fourth-place finish in 2021 under his belt, Hak would have been forgiven for feeling aggrieved at the decision to bench him in favour of Kho and Cheung, both of whom missed the cut this week.\\n“Obviously team comes first before the individual,” Hak said. “We have four great players, all can shoot low scores out there, so it doesn’t matter who plays for a stroke or the team, we’re all playing for the team.”\\n",

            "description": "Wingtech Technology, the Chinese owner of Nexperia, has named experienced general counsel Sophie Shen Xinjia, a Columbia Law School graduate, as its president amid a Sino-Dutch dispute over control of the Netherlands-based chipmaker.\\nShen’s tenure as president would be in line with that of Wingtech’s 12th board, which was formed in January and will expire by January 2028, according to the company’s filing with the Shanghai Stock Exchange on Friday.\\nShe replaced Zhang Qiuhong, who served as Wingtech’s president until her resignation on July 14, according to the firm’s filing on July 15. At the time, Shen was the company’s general counsel. Shen was named a vice-president on the same day Zhang resigned, but served as the firm’s acting president, according to the filing.\\nShen, 41, joined Nexperia in January 2017 as head of legal affairs for the Asia-Pacific region, following stints at US firm TRW and German engineering company Bosch.\\nHer appointment and experience reflected Wingtech’s current need to overcome issues surrounding Nexperia, which Dutch authorities seized control of on September 30, citing national security concerns and invoking an obscure 1952 law known as the Goods Availability Act.\\n\\nAccording to Wingtech’s filing, Shen has more than 15 years of experience as a legal counsel. That covered such areas as corporate governance and compliance, mergers and acquisitions, and cross-border transactions. Shen was also qualified to practice law in China, the company said.\\nThe Netherlands’ action on Nexperia – which included ousting Wingtech founder Zhang Xuezheng as the chipmaker’s CEO – came a day after the US government extended export control restrictions to entities at least 50 per cent owned by companies on Washington’s trade blacklist. Being wholly owned by blacklisted Wingtech, Nexperia became subject to US sanctions.\\nBeijing on October 4 responded by issuing a ban on Nexperia China and its subcontractors from exporting finished components produced in the country. About 70 per cent of all Nexperia products are assembled in its factory in Dongguan, in southern Guangdong province.\\nStill, Shen’s appointment comes at a time when there appears to be a path to resolve the dispute over Nexperia.\\nChina’s Ministry of Commerce on Saturday said it was considering exempting some Nexperia orders from the export ban that it imposed amid turmoil in global supply chains, especially in the car industry.\\nAccording to a report by The Wall Street Journal on the same day, Nexperia would resume sending chips under a framework agreement reached during the meeting between Chinese President Xi Jinping and his US counterpart, Donald Trump, on Thursday in Busan, South Korea.\\n",

The astronauts were reported to be in good condition, and the launch was declared a success.\\nAt 3.22am on Saturday, the spacecraft docked with the forward port of the T-shaped Tiangong, orbiting about 390km (242 miles) above Earth. The rendezvous and docking took roughly three and a half hours, “setting a new record for the fastest flight and docking between a Shenzhou spacecraft and the space station”, the agency said.\\nUpon entering Tiangong around 5am, commander Zhang Lu, flight engineer Wu Fei, and payload specialist Zhang Hongzhang were greeted by their Shenzhou-20 colleagues, who have been living and working on the station since April.\\n\\n\\nDuring their six-month stay, the crew will install protective devices to shield the space station from space debris, test new spacesuits and conduct 27 scientific experiments focused on biotechnology, materials science, microgravity physics and advanced space technologies.\\nThe rodent experiment, which involves two male and two female lab mice, will be carried out while both crews are aboard Tiangong. The astronauts will monitor how weightlessness, confinement and radiation affect the animals’ physiology and behaviour. The research is expected to provide insights for future long-duration human space flight.\\nThe mice will return to Earth with the Shenzhou-20 crew in about five days, according to state broadcaster CCTV.\\nAmong the Shenzhou-21 crew, commander Zhang Lu flew on Shenzhou-15 three years ago, while 32-year-old Wu, from the China Academy of Space Technology, is the country’s youngest astronaut to be sent to space.\\nZhang Hongzhang, a researcher at the Chinese Academy of Sciences, specialises in vanadium flow batteries – large, rechargeable energy storage systems used mainly for storing electricity from renewable sources such as solar and wind.\\nThe Shenzhou-21 mission marks China’s 10th crewed flight to Tiangong since June 2021. China is also training two Pakistani astronauts, one of whom is expected to join a future short-term mission to Tiangong under a bilateral space cooperation agreement signed earlier this year.\\nTiangong, designed to operate for at least a decade, represents China’s ambition to maintain a long-term human presence in low Earth orbit.\\nMeanwhile, the International Space Station (ISS), built by a Nasa-led partnership, is marking 25 years of continuous human occupancy this weekend. The ISS partners plan to continue operations until 2030, after which Nasa and SpaceX are expected to guide the station into a controlled re-entry over the South Pacific Ocean, in a remote region known as Point Nemo.\\n",

            "description": "A young man in China who teamed up with his friends to kill his mother in a fake road accident to pocket her insurance has shocked the nation.\\nThe 23-year-old son, surnamed Lu, and his friend, identified as Yang, were sentenced to death for intentional killing.\\nAnother man, Cheng, was sentenced to seven years in jail for assisting in the crime.\\nThe verdict was handed down by Taizhou Intermediate People’s Court in eastern Zhejiang province in April but was only made public recently, the news outlet The Paper reported.\\n\\nAll three defendants have appealed but a verdict has not been reached.\\nLu and his two friends were former classmates at a secondary school in Taizhou.\\nThey came up with the fraudulent scheme after Lu’s mother, surnamed Xu, was injured in a road accident in April 2023 and received 320,000 yuan (US$45,000) in compensation from an insurance policy.\\nLu and Yang withdrew the money from Xu’s bank account before squandering it on luxury items.\\nThey initially planned to jab Xu in the eyes, hoping to get the insurance compensation from her injuries.\\n\\nWhen that scheme failed, they jabbed Lu’s father in the eyes with a bamboo stick, leading them to successfully get his insurance compensation of 1,300 yuan (US$180).\\nEmboldened, the trio embarked on a deadly fraud involving much more money.\\nYang suggested to Lu that they stage a car accident to kill his grandfather; the former said he had heard that road accident offenders whose victims were elderly would not be jailed.\\nLu did not agree because he was brought up by his grandfather.\\nThey settled on targeting his mother with whom he had a bad relationship.\\n“Yang told me that if we kill my mother and receive the insurance compensation, my family’s life will be improved a lot. So I agreed to kill my mother,” Lu told police.\\nOn September 30, 2023, Lu asked his mother to go out with him and left her waiting at the roadside. Yang then drove a car, with Cheng sitting alongside him, and smashed into the mother.\\n\\nXu was pronounced dead in hospital. She was 44.\\nLu aroused police suspicion when the stories he and his two friends told investigators did not match.\\nThe criminal trio had even decided how they would split the insurance cash.\\nThe court ruled that the men should be severely punished because of their despicable intentions which posed a malicious impact on society.\\n“They deserve to be damned,” said one online observer.\\n“How wretched the mother was. I am speechless about her son. I do not know how to describe this son and his two friends,” said another.\\n",
