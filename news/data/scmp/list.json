            "title": "Hong Kong’s Lan Kwai Fong could get 25% business boost on Halloween: Allan Zeman",
            "description": "Hong Kong’s party district Lan Kwai Fong could see a 20 to 25 per cent jump in business this Halloween compared with last year, according to a nightlife tycoon, who cited a “crazy” week-long build-up of costumed revellers and “fully booked” venues.\\nLan Kwai Fong Group chairman Allan Zeman, also dubbed the father of the nightlife district in Central, joined in the festivities leading up to Halloween by cosplaying as the character Wednesday from the Addams Family while walking on a red carpet in a public appearance earlier this month to help promote tourism in the city.\\nWith so many revellers expected to crowd the streets at Lan Kwai Fong, police imposed special traffic arrangements by closing roads in the area from 2pm in D’Aguilar Street between Wyndham Street and Wellington Street, Lan Kwai Fong, Wing Wah Lane, Wo On Lane, Wellington Street between Wyndham Street and D’Aguilar Street and On Lan Street.\\nPolice warned that more roads in the area could be sealed off depending on the crowd situation.\\nZeman said on Friday his forecast was based on business being “much, much better” in recent months and the festival falling on a Friday.\\n“I’m looking at anywhere from 20 per cent, 25 per cent above last year. Lan Kwai Fong has been crazy with many, many people dressed up in different costumes … all week. So there’s a momentum building for tonight,” he said.\\n“We have a lot of pre-bookings. A lot of the bars and restaurants have been booked, fully booked, actually.\\n“Business the last few months has been much, much better in Hong Kong and Lan Kwai Fong. So I’m expecting it’ll be very, very good.”\\n\\nZeman added that Halloween coinciding on Friday would make it “a very good night”, because people could stay out late given that fewer people worked on the weekend.\\nLan Kwai Fong Association’s director Anthea Cheung said some operators had launched “Halloween party tickets with early bird discounts to drive pre-bookings”.\\nShe said restaurants at Lan Kwai Fong were using “structured first and second seating sessions” and bars were “promoting free-flow drink packages to ensure higher per-capita spend”.\\nHowever, Ben Leung Lap-yan, charter president of the Licensed Bar and Club Association of Hong Kong, raised operators’ concerns about a repeat of history in recent years that revellers packed streets without spending, which forced them to lower prices at the expense of their profit margins to attract customers.\\n“This is of course a problem that our industry operators are worried about,” Leung said.\\n“After all, Hong Kong’s high rent and high wages are also putting pressure on our operators. Consumers are also inclined to choose high value-for-money options.”\\nBut Zeman rejected the idea that low spending was a new norm, arguing the problem was limited to unpopular venues and that “Lan Kwai Fong is not a cheap place”.\\n“The good operators, their businesses have been very decent,” Zeman said.\\n",

            "description": "Robot dogs might not be able to survive a potential assault on Taiwan, based on the results of an amphibious landing exercise carried out by the People’s Liberation Army and broadcast in a documentary aired by state broadcaster CCTV.\\nThe four-legged robots, loaded with explosives, were released by the first wave of landing forces in the exercise. They ran across ditches, blocks and barricades on the beachhead in an attempt to clear a passage for the penetration of the enemy defensive line.\\nAt the same time, first-person view (FPV) unmanned aerial vehicles were deployed by specialised drone units to strike the enemy firing positions along with armed combat troops, providing fire suppression for the robot dogs, the documentary showed.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThroughout the operation, reconnaissance drones monitored the battlefield and ascertained enemy positions while more robot dogs could be seen serving as ammunition transporters for soldiers deployed in scattered positions.\\nMeanwhile, another robot dog with a machine gun on its back accompanied a team of paratroopers advancing through the jungle to infiltrate the enemy’s rear, then led the way to intercept enemy reinforcements.\\nThis happened after the drill director declared that the PLA’s amphibious armoured vehicles were damaged by defensive artillery, causing congestion on the advance route in the full-course amphibious landing exercise, according to CCTV.\\nThe operation’s wide use and seamless integration of the systems indicated that the PLA has adapted to unmanned warfare and developed significant capabilities. However, the results of the drill also appear to reveal the limitations of military drones.\\nAccording to the documentary, a defending soldier was able to shoot down a robot dog from a distance as it moved on the open beach. And the FPV drones did not seem to have weakened the fortified enemy positions.\\n\\n\\n“Under the circumstances that the unmanned equipment had already been destroyed, we were forced to resort to the most primitive approach – using humans,” landing unit commander Ren Mengqi told CCTV.\\nThe crude and dangerous method – attempting to breach a path by ordering soldiers to crawl under heavy fire and place explosive charges by hand – resulted in “heavy casualties”, he said.\\nThe documentary also showed that the defences on the beach were not cleared until the infiltration team launched an attack from behind.\\nThe report did not specify the time or location of the drill, but some of the footage was previously aired in Forging Ahead, a documentary series commemorating Army Day on August 1, which included scenes drawn from the Strait Thunder 2025A exercise in April.\\nBeijing regards Taiwan as part of China, to be reunited by force if necessary. Most countries, including the US, do not recognise the island as independent, but Washington is opposed to any attempt to take it by force and is committed to supplying Taipei with arms.\\nThe PLA has intensified its posture around the self-ruling island in recent years, particularly after the pro-independence Taiwanese leader William Lai Ching-te took office last year and made a series of remarks that repeatedly angered Beijing.\\nStrait Thunder 2025A was one of at least six large-scale joint exercises around Taiwan conducted by the PLA since August 2022, each featuring different manoeuvres and showcasing new operational abilities.\\n",

            "description": "Halloween, much like China’s Hungry Ghost Festival, has its roots in tales of spirits and the supernatural. But unlike the more solemn tone of the Hungry Ghost Festival, Halloween in Hong Kong has evolved into a lively, playful celebration, fuelled by the city’s creativity and curiosity, and inspired by both Western and local traditions.\\nAlthough there’s no clear record of when the city began embracing Halloween, photographs from the 1980s show small-scale school parties with children dressing up for the occasion. By the 90s, Lan Kwai Fong had become a carnival of costumes and, in the 2000s, theme parks joined in, with Ocean Park’s haunted houses and Disneyland’s spooky parades transforming the night into a grand spectacle.\\nJoin us as we look back through the South China Morning Post’s picture archives to see how Hong Kong transformed Halloween into one of its most theatrical and commercial celebrations.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "title": "Takaichi-Lee meeting raises hopes of Japan and South Korea burying history row",
            "description": "The first meeting between Japanese Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi and South Korean President Lee Jae-myung could not have gone off to a better start, with analysts noting the two leaders’ warm rapport sealed with handshakes, smiles and vows to look to the future.\\nWhile they projected goodwill during their summit ahead of the Apec forum in the South Korean city of Gyeongju on Thursday, long-standing tensions over history and territorial disputes, and domestic political pressures arising from the bilateral ties are likely to resurface at some point, according to analysts.\\n“For now, they appear to be putting very positive faces on, but there are a lot of potential obstacles ahead,” said Ben Ascione, an assistant professor of politics and international relations at Tokyo’s Waseda University.\\n“When Takaichi was first elected head of the Liberal Democratic Party and then prime minister, there was a lot of fear that this was going to spell doom”, following recent progress in Tokyo’s relations with Seoul and Beijing, Ascione told This Week in Asia.\\nThere have been concerns that her position on the region’s shared history, her past visits to the controversial Yasukuni Shrine in Tokyo and the right flank of her Liberal Democratic Party ignoring “Japan’s colonial and historic transgressions” could cause friction between Japan and its neighbours, he added.\\nWhile it was still early in their diplomatic relationship, the two leaders’ focus on the future rather than the past was a positive, Ascione said.\\n“They avoided the worst possible outcome in their first meeting, but it remains to be seen whether this cooperation will be substantive and can be solidified under Takaichi’s leadership,” he said.\\n\\nIn their first summit, just before the opening of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum, Takaichi and Lee agreed to strengthen existing cooperation and shuttle diplomacy between Tokyo and Seoul.\\nTakaichi, who was elected prime minister nine days earlier and was facing her second major diplomatic test after hosting US President Donald Trump in Tokyo on Tuesday, described the two countries as “important neighbours”. She also used the occasion to underline the growing importance of the three-way security cooperation with the US at a time of challenges to regional security.\\nIn return, Lee said Japan and South Korea were “neighbours who share many similarities” and should work together to boost ties at a time of worsening global uncertainty.\\nBoth leaders described their discussions as cordial and forward-looking and spoke about the possibility of Tokyo hosting their next face-to-face meeting.\\nNeither Takaichi nor Lee made any mention of wartime “comfort women,” Koreans who were forced to work in Japanese mines and heavy industries during Tokyo’s colonial control of the peninsula or ongoing disagreements over the sovereignty of islands in the disputed Sea of Japan, or East Sea, analysts have noted.\\nLeif-Eric Easley, a professor of international studies at Ewha Womans University in Seoul, said the two leaders had opted for a pragmatic approach.\\n“The theme of the Lee-Takaichi summit was ‘if it’s fixed, don’t break it’,” he said. “Both leaders deserve credit for their pragmatism in putting economic and security interests above partisan politics and contested history.”\\n\\nThat was echoed in the South Korean media, with an opinion article in the Chosun newspaper suggesting Takaichi had adopted a “pragmatic diplomatic framework”. It pointed out that Takaichi had already skipped one opportunity since being elected prime minister this month to pay her respects at Yasukuni, where the souls of Japan’s war dead include 14 class A war criminals.\\nJapanese media took a similar position, with the left-leaning Asahi applauding the prime minister for getting the relationship “off to a safe start” and the Nikkei Shimbun mentioning the two leaders’ “realist diplomacy”.\\nThe media outlets in the two countries have also emphasised that it is of critical importance for Tokyo and Seoul to form a firm alliance due to the common security challenges they face and Washington’s inconsistent approach to regional security and diplomacy.\\n“My first impressions are quite positive,” said Hiromi Murakami, a professor of political science at the Tokyo campus of Temple University. “Before they met, there were concerns that Takaichi might take a harder line or even act provocatively, but as far as we can tell, she has been very careful and reserved.\\n“Takaichi is, of course, worried about the security situation in the region and wants to build on the trilateral alliance with the US and South Korea. This was an important first step in achieving that.”\\nThe real test will come when the first bumps of their relationship surface, according to Murakami.\\n“The same issues that caused problems in the past still exist. But it is the same for Lee, and it will be in his best interests to also try to avoid those issues and quickly overcome them when they need to. They will both need to be pragmatic.”\\n",

She also called on the audience to cast a vote via a mobile app.\\nUpon her arrest in July this year, police discovered Instagram messages on her mobile phone in which she encouraged a friend to join the vote.\\n\\nLan told police that she had filmed the videos abroad at her ex-boyfriend’s instructions, but denied ever voting at the election or joining the group in any capacity.\\nShe said Victor Ho Leung-mau, a co-founder of the group’s now-dissolved electoral committee, provided her with the scripts and paid her C$100 for each video appearance.\\nThe defendant pleaded guilty to a count of “doing with a seditious intention an act or acts that had a seditious intention”, which is punishable by up to seven years in jail.\\nAny Hong Kong resident committing sedition outside the city can be held liable for the crime under the ordinance, which was enacted as a requirement of Article 23 of the Basic Law, the city’s mini-constitution.\\nIn court, Chief Magistrate Victor So Wai-tak questioned the degree of Lan’s involvement and noted a social media message that appeared to suggest she was originally slated to work for the group as a “councillor assistant”.\\nDefence counsel Luke McGuinniety said the text was written without his client’s knowledge and stressed she had no intention to join the parliament or take part in its future elections.\\nMcGuinniety described the defendant as a young and naive woman who toed the line and followed her then boyfriend’s ill-gotten advice.\\nHe said Lan had become dependent on Lam after moving to Canada due to her inability to communicate in English and her difficulties adjusting to the new environment.\\nAfter the couple broke up, the 19-year-old thought that she could wipe her slate clean by returning to Hong Kong, the lawyer continued.\\n“It’s an indication of her naivety and total lack of understanding of the significance of her actions, the criminality of her involvement … She came back to Hong Kong completely unaware of the stupidity of her actions,” McGuinniety said.\\n“The obsession for likes, fanfare and approval may very well be what trapped this woman.”\\nThe court adjourned sentencing until November 13, pending a background assessment of the defendant.\\nLan, who has been detained since her prosecution in August, remains in custody.\\n",

This was their first in-person meeting and took place on the sidelines of a gathering of defence chiefs from Asean in Kuala Lumpur.\\n“This new 10-year defence framework we signed is ambitious,” Hegseth added. “It’s a significant step for our two militaries, a road map for deeper and even more meaningful collaboration ahead.”\\nSingh said that the framework will “open new doors” to bilateral ties.\\nRelations between New Delhi and Washington have deteriorated sharply in recent months, following the Trump administration’s decision to impose a 50 per cent tariff on Indian exports – partly as punishment for purchases of Russian oil.

            "title": "Lemongrass recipe: how to make Vietnamese rice noodles with lemongrass chicken",
            "description": "Lemongrass is a useful plant. It is used as an insect repellent and also yields citronella oil, which is said to soothe the stomach, ease depression and stimulate the mind.\\nOf course, it also has culinary uses. The thick, tough, juicy stalks of the lemongrass plant are used as a flavouring in many Southeast Asian cuisines. The flavour is somewhat like lemon, but more subtle and complex.\\nLemongrass is usually sold as stalks that are about 30cm (12 inches) long. Most of the plant needs to be trimmed off, and the dry outer layers should be peeled away to get at the thick, moist core at the base of the stalk (the top portion and outer leaves do not need to be wasted, though; you can chop them up and brew them into a tisane).\\nBecause the core is tough, it needs to be very finely sliced, or you can cut it into thin pieces and pound them in a mortar, to use in spice blends. If you are using larger pieces (to flavour soups, for instance), then bruise the core by crushing it with the flat side of a knife.\\n\\nLemongrass is used in many types of sambal. To make one for fish, finely chop the juicy core of several lemongrass stalks. Cook the lemongrass in oil with sliced shallot, minced garlic, finely chopped bird’s-eye chilli and a small chunk of belacan (dried, fermented shrimp paste).\\nCook for several minutes, or until the ingredients are fragrant and cohesive, then add fresh lime juice and season with salt and pepper. Spread the paste in the cavity and on the skin of a whole fish.\\nWrap the fish in banana leaves and grill over hot coals. Squeeze more lime juice over the fish before serving.\\n\\nVietnamese rice noodles with lemongrass chicken (bun ga nuong)\\nI use chicken thighs for this dish, and remove the bones myself – shops usually sell boneless whole legs, with the thigh and drumstick together. The drumstick has a lot of tendons that need to be removed.\\nCutting out the bone from the thigh takes about 30 seconds, but if you can find just boneless thighs (without the drumsticks), then use those if you prefer. If you substitute boneless chicken breasts, take care not to overcook them – they will need about 10 minutes under the grill.\\nFor the lemongrass chicken:\\n4 bone-in chicken thighs, about 200 grams each (or 180 grams each if they are boneless)\\n90ml fish sauce\\n30 grams granulated sugar\\n2 lemongrass stalks, the juicy lower stem (about 8cm) only\\n4 garlic cloves, peeled\\n2 spring onions\\n½ tsp freshly ground black pepper\\nFor the nuoc cham (dipping sauce):\\n45 grams granulated sugar\\n60ml fish sauce\\n25ml fresh lime juice\\n2-3 garlic cloves, peeled\\n2-4 red bird’s-eye chillies\\nFor the noodles and to serve:\\n250 grams thin rice noodles\\n45ml cooking oil\\n3 spring onions\\n50 grams roasted, shelled peanuts\\n150 grams shredded carrot\\n1 Asian cucumber\\nLettuce leaves\\nFresh herbs, such as mint, Thai basil and fresh coriander\\nBean sprouts\\n1. Marinate the chicken. If using bone-in thighs, use a sharp paring knife to cut down to the bone on the meaty side of the thigh, slicing it along the entire length of the bone. Use the tip of the knife to detach the meat from one end by cutting it around the joint, then scrape the meat from the bone until you reach the other joint. Detach the meat from the second joint end. Put the boneless thighs in a medium-sized bowl.\\n2. Mix the fish sauce with the sugar and stir to dissolve. Mix in the pepper.\\n3. Use the flat side of a meat mallet (or the side of a cleaver) to lightly crush the length of the lemongrass stalks. Mince them as finely as possible and add the pieces to the bowl with the fish sauce and sugar mixture.\\n4. Finely mince the garlic and spring onions, then add them to the bowl. Pour the mixture over the chicken thighs and mix well. Refrigerate for about three hours, mixing occasionally. Remove from the fridge about 30 minutes before you want to cook the chicken.\\n5. Put the rice noodles in a large bowl, add tepid water to cover them by about 2cm and leave to soak until needed.\\n6. Make the nuoc cham. Pour the sugar into a bowl and add 50ml of hot water. Stir to dissolve the sugar, then cool to room temperature.\\n\\n7. Add the fish sauce and lime juice to the bowl with the sugar. Mince the garlic and thinly slice the chillies, squeezing out and discarding the seeds as you go. Add the garlic and chillies to the bowl, then set aside until needed.\\n8. Prepare the noodles and other ingredients for the lemongrass chicken. Drain the soaked noodles in a colander. Bring a large pot of water to the boil, add the noodles and cook for about 30 seconds, or until just tender. Drain in a colander, then put them into a mixing bowl.\\n9. Finely mince the spring onions, then put them into a small pan. Add the cooking oil and place over a medium flame. Heat the oil until it sizzles, then turn off the flame and cool slightly. Pour the oil and spring onion over the noodles and mix with chopsticks or tongs until the noodles are lightly coated.\\n10. Roughly chop the peanuts, then put them into a small bowl. Slice the cucumber in half lengthwise, then cut into thin slices.\\n11. Put the lettuce leaves, bean sprouts, herbs and cucumber on a plate. Add a small amount of the shredded carrot to the bowl holding the nuoc cham, then put the rest on the plate with the herbs and lettuce.\\n12. Heat the oven grill to high. Place the chicken thighs, skin-side down, on a grill rack placed over a pan and slide it into the oven so the meat is about 3cm away from the heating element. Cook for about six minutes, or until the chicken is brown in spots. Flip the pieces over and slide the grill rack back into the oven. Grill for another nine minutes, or until the chicken is cooked through and lightly charred in spots. If the chicken browns too much, put the pan further away from the heat.\\n\\n13. Leave the chicken pieces at room temperature for about five minutes, then slice about 1cm thick.\\n14. Take a few strands of rice vermicelli and dip them into the nuoc cham, then taste. If the sauce is too strong, dilute it with a little water.\\n15. Divide the rice vermicelli between four individual serving bowls and place one chicken thigh over each portion. Let the guests add the peanuts, vegetables and herbs to their bowl as they wish, mixing them in along with some nuoc cham.\\nThis content first appeared in Post Magazine in 2014 and 2020.\\n",

            "description": "The port-fee postponement announced by China and the United States offers a glimmer of relief to the shipping industry, but analysts warn that a one-year suspension is insufficient to eliminate persistent uncertainties, as maritime measures continue to serve as leverage in broader geopolitical tensions.\\nFollowing the highly anticipated meeting between presidents Xi Jinping and Donald Trump in South Korea on Thursday, China’s Ministry of Commerce announced that the US would suspend its Section 301 investigation targeting China’s maritime and shipbuilding sectors and related measures for a year. And in response, China would subsequently pause its retaliatory port fee for the same period.\\nAlthough the US did not specify when the suspension would take effect, and China stated that it would only follow through if the US acts first, the agreement appears to offer a short-term reprieve – or at least sends a positive signal – amid continuous volatility in the shipping industry and global trade this year.\\nThe World Shipping Council was “very encouraged” to hear the news and was looking forward to more specific details, the Washington-headquartered trade association representing the international liner shipping industry said by email.\\n“Global trade flows best when it flows freely, and a suspension of ship fees by the United States and China is a win for farmers, exporters and consumers. Avoiding additional costs helps keep trade competitive and maintains access to critical shipping lanes,” the trade body said.\\nAt freight booking and payment platform Freightos, head of research Judah Levine said the suspension was unlikely to trigger a surge in transpacific freight demand, but it does provide supply-chain stakeholders with greater certainty and stability than at any previous point this year.\\nAnd at shipbroker Banchero Costa, global head of research Ralph Leszczynski said: “These policies on port fees on both sides were just a politics-driven decision which did not take into account the practical realities on the ground.”\\n\\n\\nThe port fees imposed by Washington and Beijing are based on a vessel’s ownership, operator, flag state and country of build – a set of criteria that has been widely criticised as ambiguous, creating uncertainty and undermining trade efficiency for both sides.\\nGiven how impractical those criteria were, especially considering the US administration’s history of inconsistent trade policies, there have been broad expectations that port fees would be reversed or at least watered down, Leszczynski said.\\nHowever, since neither side has officially confirmed the postponement in writing, uncertainty remains, though both Washington and Beijing have struck a positive tone regarding the results of the presidential meeting and future negotiations.\\nHailing his meeting with Xi as “amazing”, Trump said he planned to visit China in April, followed by a trip by Xi to the US later.\\nSpeaking to reporters on Thursday after the meeting, Trump said the port fee was “no longer an issue”.\\nGiven the time-limited nature of the suspension, shipping lines are likely to maintain some compliance with restrictions while maintaining vessel-reshuffling plans, Lars Jensen, CEO of maritime consultancy Vespucci Maritime, said via social media on Thursday.\\nSimon Heaney, a senior manager of container research at maritime consultancy Drewry, also expressed hope in a social media post that “this agreement has some permanency, something sorely lacking thus far”.\\n“The whole sorry saga is a painful reminder how shipping is just a pawn in the superpower tussle for supremacy,” he said.\\n",

            "description": "Tesla will make a return to the world’s largest import trade fair in Shanghai next week, after skipping two major events in China’s commercial hub over the past two years.\\nThe US electric vehicle (EV) maker will showcase its Cybercab robotaxi at the China International Import Expo (CIIE), marking the Asia-Pacific debut of its driverless model.\\n“The trade fair will help Tesla show how it is actively integrating artificial intelligence into the real world,” the company said in a statement. “We are redefining the labour, transportation, and new energy industries.”\\nTesla’s comeback to the CIIE comes as its mainland sales fell 6 per cent year on year in the first nine months of 2025, underscoring intensifying competition from local rivals.\\nMainland China – the world’s largest automotive and EV market – remains Tesla’s second-largest market after the US.\\nIts Shanghai Gigafactory, the company’s biggest production hub globally, delivered 432,704 Model 3 and Model Y vehicles to mainland customers between January and September, representing 4.9 per cent of the country’s total EV deliveries during that period.\\nTesla once commanded a 16 per cent share of China’s EV market when it began local production in 2020, but its share slid to 6.9 per cent last year amid an intensifying price war and the rise of domestic brands.\\nThe company unveiled its Cybercab in the US last year. CEO Elon Musk said then that Tesla aimed to produce more than 2 million units annually, with mass production expected to start next year.\\nTesla was absent from last year’s CIIE and from the Shanghai Auto Show in April, without offering an explanation.\\n\\nLaunched in 2018, the CIIE serves as a platform for China to demonstrate its commitment to free trade and greater market access. It is also regarded by many foreign firms as a key marketing opportunity, as Beijing encourages local companies to buy imported goods.\\nIn 2024, purchase agreements worth US$80 billion were signed during the six-day event, up 2 per cent from the previous year.\\nThis year’s fair will begin on Wednesday, featuring participation from international carmakers including General Motors, Volkswagen and BMW, according to the organisers.\\nSeparately, the Shanghai Auto Show, held every two years, drew more than 70 carmakers from 26 countries and regions this year, with over 100 new models launched, according to the Shanghai Council for the Promotion of International Trade.\\nChina could see as many as 300,000 driverless taxis operating in its four top-tier cities by 2030, supported by rapid advances in AI and the fiercely competitive EV sector, according to UBS.\\nThat number could climb to 4 million by the late 2030s, as more passengers embraced autonomous transport, said Paul Gong, head of China automotive research at UBS.\\n",
