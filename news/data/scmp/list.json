            "title": "Idle Hong Kong seafront site gets new lease of life from private equity firm MBK Partners",
            "description": "A mega waterfront commercial site in Hong Kong’s Quarry Bay that has been left idle for nearly two decades by a now-bankrupt local businessman may finally be poised for a revival.\\nThe current owner, Marine Riches, majority owned by South Korean private equity group MBK Partners, had applied to amend plans for the site to the Town Planning Board – a move that came amid signs of recovery in Hong Kong’s retail sector and property market.\\nMarine Riches proposed to build a mixed-use development focusing on culture and tourism alongside a residential project, according to the minutes of a meeting released by the Harbourfront Commission on Friday. The meeting was aimed at seeking views of commission members on a section 12A application, which is used to propose changes to land use.\\nThe seafront site, comprising two plots totalling 91,838 sq ft on Hoi Yu Street, has undergone multiple planning revisions since the early 2000s. The plots were acquired for HK$1 billion (US$128 million) in June 2024, according to Land Registry records.\\n\\nThe plots were originally approved as industrial lots in 2001, with the first landlord, Fine Tower Associates – an entity connected to Pacific Concord Holdings – securing approval to construct a 25-storey industrial building, according to official records.\\nBusinessman Wong Sai-chung was the chairman of Pacific Concord, a Hong Kong-listed company from 1987 to 2003, and the managing director of the now-liquidated property developer China Properties Group, which delisted from the Hong Kong stock exchange in 2023.\\nFine Tower envisioned constructing an “Old Hong Kong” theme park – featuring replicas of historic architecture from Central, Wan Chai and Happy Valley – after learning that the site could be rezoned from industrial use to cultural, leisure and tourism uses. Its application submitted to the Town Planning Board was turned down in September 2003, according to the Post’s previous reporting.\\nFollowing the setback, the site remained idle for years, used only as temporary car parks.\\nIn 2017, Fine Tower began foundation work for the development of an industrial building but public pressure mounted to repurpose the site in line with a harbourfront boardwalk vision.\\nIn 2021, the Chief Executive in Council approved an in-situ land exchange to allow for a new development comprising one office block and four hotel blocks with a total of 400 rooms on top of a two-storey retail podium. Fine Tower, however, was already facing financial difficulties before the exchange was completed.\\nThe site was valued at HK$4 billion when it was put up for tender by creditors in 2022. Marine Riches purchased the plots in June 2024.\\nUnder the new amendment application, more than half of the total cultural, leisure and tourism spaces would be dedicated to a large-scale, privately owned immersive exhibition venue in Hong Kong. Marine Riches said it had secured a content partnership deal with Neon Global, a creator of immersive shows featuring popular intellectual properties – like Harry Potter, Marvel Avengers and Jurassic World – in Asia and across the world.\\nUpon completion, the development was expected to attract around 5,000 visitors daily, on par with the Hong Kong Palace Museum and the M+ Museum, the application said.\\n\\nThe project would integrate residential, retail and dining spaces – creating a new hub for residents and visitors – and directly supported the city’s priorities to boost tourism, expand cultural infrastructure, foster creative industries and provide quality housing and public space, according to the application.\\nThe application coincides with a rebound in Hong Kong’s retail sales, which saw a 3.8 per cent year-on-year increase in August, marking the fourth consecutive month of growth, aided by the city’s mega-event tourism drive.\\nThe city’s residential property market also showed signs of improvement, with lived-in home prices rising 1.3 per cent in September, their biggest gains so far this year. The city’s rental prices, at the same time, inched within a hair of their historical peak, according to data from the Rating and Valuation Department.\\nMarine Riches would also be partnering with a local developer, according to a source familiar with the matter. It was too early to disclose a construction timeline, the source added.\\nMBK did not respond to a request for comment.\\nMBK, founded in 2005 and focusing on investment in North Asia, had over US$30 billion in assets under management, according to its website. Among its notable deals was a buyout of Universal Studios Japan, one of Asia’s largest theme parks, for US$1.4 billion in 2009. It sold all of its stakes to Comcast NBCUniversal in 2017, according to media reports.\\nIt also bought five maritime theme parks in mainland China from Hong Kong-listed hospitality group Haichang Ocean Park Holdings for 6.05 billion yuan (US$843 million) in 2021.\\n",

            "title": "After delays, mammoth Grand Egyptian Museum by the Pyramids is finally opening",
            "description": "After two decades of anticipation and countless delays, the Grand Egyptian Museum is finally having its grand reveal.\\nThe museum, which was set to officially open on Saturday, highlights Egypt’s ancient civilisation and is a centrepiece of the government’s drive to boost the tourist industry, a major source of foreign currency in the cash-strapped country.\\nLocated just outside Cairo next to the famed Giza Pyramids, the US$1 billion mammoth facility is poised to become the world’s largest museum dedicated to a single civilisation with over 50,000 artefacts detailing life in ancient Egypt. By comparison, the Louvre Museum in Paris has about 35,000 pieces on display.\\nThe museum is one of the mega-projects championed by President Abdel-Fattah el-Sisi, who since taking office in 2014 embarked on massive investments in infrastructure with the aim of reviving an economy weakened by decades of stagnation and battered by the unrest that followed the 2011 Arab spring uprising.\\n\\nThe museum’s construction began in 2005, but work stopped for three years during the political turmoil that followed the 2011 uprising.\\nThe grand opening was postponed multiple times, most recently in July this year because of conflicts in the Middle East. World leaders were expected to attend the opening ceremony on Saturday.\\nDesigned by the Irish firm Heneghan Peng Architects, the museum, known as GEM, boasts a towering, triangular glass façade imitating the nearby pyramids.\\nIn its entrance atrium stands the granite colossus of one of Egypt’s most famed pharaohs, Ramesses the Great. The 3,200-year-old, 11-metre-tall statue was moved to the museum after decades of standing in the centre of a traffic-clogged roundabout in front of Cairo’s main railway station.\\nFrom the atrium, a grand six-storey staircase lined with ancient statues leads up to the main galleries and a view of the nearby pyramids. A bridge links the museum to the pyramids, allowing tourists to move between them either on foot or via electric, environment-friendly vehicles, according to museum officials.\\nThe museum includes 258,000 sq ft of permanent exhibition space, a children’s museum and conference and educational facilities, and a commercial area as well as a large conservation centre.\\n\\nThe 12 main galleries, which opened last year, exhibit antiquities spanning from prehistoric times to the Roman era, organised by era and by themes.\\nMany of the 50,000 artefacts in the GEM were moved from the Egyptian Museum, a packed, century-old building in downtown Cairo’s Tahrir Square. Others were recently unearthed from ancient cemeteries, including the Saqqara necropolis, another complex of pyramids and tombs about 22km (14 miles) south of the museum.\\nThe halls are equipped with advanced technology and feature multimedia presentations including mixed-reality shows to help explain ancient Egypt to new generations, said Ahmed Ghoneim, the museum’s CEO.\\n“We’re using the language that the Gen Z uses right now,” he said in an interview. “Gen Z doesn’t use any more the labels that we read as old people but rather use technology.”\\nSaturday’s grand opening would include the inauguration of two halls dedicated to the 5,000 artefacts from the collection of King Tutankhamun.\\nThe collection was being displayed in its entirety for the first time since British archaeologist Howard Carter discovered King Tut’s tomb in 1922 in the southern city of Luxor. The old Egyptian Museum did not have enough space to show all the tomb’s treasures at once.\\n\\nSome masterpieces were restored at the museum’s conservation centre, including the boy pharaoh’s three funeral beds and six chariots, said Jailan Mohamed, chief restorer at the conservation centre.\\nThey will be displayed along with his golden throne, his gold-covered sarcophagus and his burial mask, made of gold, quartzite, lapis lazuli and coloured glass. The mask’s beard was accidentally knocked off and hastily glued back on with epoxy in 2014, before a German-Egyptian team of experts fixed it the following year.\\nAnother centrepiece of the museum was the 4,600-year-old solar boat of King Khufu, the pharaoh who was credited with building the Great Pyramid of Giza.\\nThe 43-metre-long wooden boat, discovered in the 1950s, was buried next to the Great Pyramid for Khufu - or Cheops as he was also known - to use in the afterlife. In 2021, it was moved from its display site by the pyramids into the Grand Egyptian Museum on a remote-controlled vehicle imported from Belgium.\\nThe government hoped the museum would draw more tourists and provide the foreign currency Egypt needed to shore up its economy.\\nThe tourism sector suffered from years of political turmoil and violence following the 2011 Arab spring uprising. In recent years, the sector has started to recover from the coronavirus pandemic, and the effects of Russia’s war on Ukraine. Both Russia and Ukraine are a major source of tourists visiting Egypt.\\nA record number of 15.7 million visited the country in 2024, according to official figures, and the government aims to attract 30 million visitors by 2032.\\nAuthorities overhauled the whole area around the museum and the pyramids. Roads were paved and a metro station is being constructed outside the museum gates to ease access to the sites. An airport, Sphinx International Airport, was also opened west of Cairo - 40 minutes from the museum.\\nHassan Allam, CEO of Hassan Allam Holding, the firm operating the museum, said they were expecting between 15,000 and 20,000 visitors a day at the museum.\\n“The world has been waiting … Everyone’s excited,” he said.\\n",

            "title": "Chinese medicinal wines still have a place in TCM, treating arthritis, period pain and more",
            "description": "It might sound like the stuff of nightmares: Chinese medicinal shop shelves lined with jars containing snakes and lizards pickled in a murky mix of liquid and herbs. But they serve a healthy purpose.\\nChinese medicinal wines have been around for almost as long as traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) itself.\\nTo make them, snakes, geckos and other creatures are steeped in alcohol for months or years, along with herbs, to extract their perceived medicinal “essence”. They are used as powerful tonics to treat ailments from rheumatism to arthritis, and to boost male vitality by warming the body and promoting blood circulation.\\nThe popularity of Chinese medicinal wines in Hong Kong has waned since their heyday in the 1970s and ’80s, when mainland Chinese varieties such as Shi Quan Da Bu Jiu – “the 10 complete wellness wine” – were household names.\\n\\nHong Kong-based TCM practitioner Samuel To Ching-san cites several reasons for their fall in popularity.\\n“In the last few decades, alcohol has been seen as something detrimental to your health; you can’t be taking medicinal wines before driving or before work, and preparing Chinese medicinal wines takes time, something that modern lifestyles have less and less of,” he says.\\nBut according to To, it is the wines’ alcohol content that helps make them fast-acting and effective.\\n“Alcohol acts as a conduit, directing medicinal effects and helping the medicine reach the affected area quickly,” he says. “It also has a synergistic effect, dissolving the active components of herbs into the wine,” making it easier for the patient to absorb them.\\nTo adds, however, that Chinese medicinal wines’ efficacy is only relative to other forms of TCM; “the speed of modern medicine has left this advantage in the dust”.\\n\\nBrewing medicinal wines and elixirs has been part of Chinese culture for almost 2,000 years. Ancient oracle bones from the Shang dynasty (1600BC-1046BC) reveal the earliest uses of wine in rituals and medicine.\\nDuring the Han (206BC-AD220) and Jin (265-420) dynasties, Taoist alchemists concocted mystical elixirs in their quest for immortality, sometimes with dangerous results. They used cinnabar – a toxic ore of mercury – and rare minerals in medicinal wines.\\nLater, in the Tang (618-907) dynasty, Sun Simiao, known as China’s king of medicine, refined wine-based remedies for ailments ranging from fatigue to arthritis, recording the recipes in texts that would endure for centuries.\\nDuring the Ming dynasty (1368-1644), Chinese doctor Li Shizhen catalogued hundreds of tonics infused with everything from ginseng to wolfberries and even snake in his book, Bencao Gangmu, or the Compendium of Materia Medica, enshrining their use in Chinese medicine.\\nSnake wines are on the list of Hong Kong’s intangible cultural heritage. To make them, the defanged animals are gutted and then steamed and immersed in spirits such as yellow wine with medicinal herbs.\\nThe wine is aged for one to two years and is said to be good for “expelling wind and dampness”. In TCM, wind and dampness are related to joint and muscle pain, stiffness and swelling. Removing them from the body is also believed to boost core energy, strength and overall vitality.\\n\\nDepending on the combination of ingredients, medicinal wines can help with a variety of ailments related to the circulatory system, from rheumatism and joint pain to period pain, indigestion and cold hands and feet.\\nSnakes and lizards are not a necessary ingredient for these wines; many of them are infused with ingredients such as ginger, cinnamon, cloves, Sichuan peppercorns, safflower, goji berries and ginseng.\\nTo says that, because of the alcoholic nature of wine therapy, there are several things to keep in mind.\\n“People who are taking sleeping pills, antidepressants, antibiotics, anticoagulants, oral antidiabetic drugs, antihypertensives and even painkillers should not use wine therapy,” he warns.\\n“Sometimes it could worsen the condition; it’s best to consult your prescribing doctor to see if they can be taken together,” he adds.\\n\\nSince wine therapy usually needs to be taken over time, To suggests taking small shots daily.\\n“There are different ABVs [alcohol levels] when it comes to medicinal wines. Patients shouldn’t take more than 30ml a day for the stronger ones and no more than 50ml a day for the milder wines,” To says.\\n“It’s better to drink the wine after meals and not on an empty stomach, and if you’re taking it for wellness reasons such as warming up cold hands and feet, then I suggest drinking it in alternating weeks, such as one week on and one week off.”\\nTo also says that it is difficult to control medicinal wines’ potency.\\n“Depending on the length of time that it’s been infused and the quality of the herbs used, it is hard to gauge the efficacy of the wines. In contrast, it is a lot easier to gauge the effects of herbal medicine and acupuncture.”\\nDespite these caveats, To still believes that medicinal wine therapy has a place in TCM.\\n“It has fallen out of favour in recent years, but it is the best therapy for certain conditions if used correctly. We should not forget this part of TCM culture.”\\nLike what you read? Follow SCMP Lifestyle on Facebook, X and Instagram. You can also sign up for our eNewsletter here.\\n",

            "description": "OpenAI, Oracle and Related Digital will build a data centre campus of more than 1 gigawatt in Saline Township, Michigan, as part of their Stargate push to expand US artificial intelligence infrastructure capacity.\\nThe announcement made on Thursday underscores the AI industry’s surging appetite for computing power, driven by the pursuit of technology capable of matching or surpassing human intelligence.\\nThe companies said it was a multibillion-dollar investment, without disclosing the exact figure. Industry executives have said 1GW of computing power, enough to power roughly 750,000 US homes, can cost around US$50 billion.\\nThe construction is slated to begin in early 2026.\\nThe project is part of Oracle and OpenAI’s 4.5-GW Stargate expansion and, together with six other US sites, raises the infrastructure group’s planned capacity to more than 8GW and total investment to over US$450 billion in the next three years.\\nOpenAI said the move kept Stargate ahead of schedule to meet its US$500 billion, 10GW commitment. The start-up has shared few details on how it plans to fund the spending.\\n\\nEarlier this week, it completed a restructuring that frees the ChatGPT maker to move away from its nonprofit roots. Reuters has reported it was laying the groundwork for an initial public offering that could value the company at up to US$1 trillion.\\nBut surging valuations of AI companies and their massive AI spending commitments, which total more than US$1 trillion for OpenAI, have raised fears that the AI boom is inflating into a bubble.\\nOpenAI said on Thursday Related Digital would develop the Michigan project, which is expected to create more than 2,500 union construction jobs.\\n“This project will help ensure Michigan is a key part of building the AI infrastructure that will power the next generation of American innovation,” said Peter Hoeschele, OpenAI’s vice-president of industrial compute.\\n",

            "title": "Asia to play key role in decarbonisation amid shift to renewables: report",
            "description": "Carbon dioxide emissions are expected to peak globally next year, marking a turning point in the energy transition, with Asia set to play a prominent role in decarbonisation.\\nThe findings were revealed in a report by Rystad Energy released on Thursday, which noted that while the shift to renewable energy had gained momentum, peak oil demand was set to occur only by the 2030s, with near-term demand for fossil fuels including gas likely to be resilient.\\nEmerging countries such as Pakistan and Thailand are among leaders in renewable energy adoption, putting the world on track for a 1.9 degree Celsius temperature rise by 2100 – below the upper range of the 2015 Paris Agreement.\\nWhile the world moves from growth to decline in emissions, the report urges faster deployment of renewables to limit warming to 1.5 degrees or the lower range of the Paris deal.\\nBy 2030, low-carbon sources were expected to capture 46 per cent of all energy investment, compared with 30 per cent for fossil fuels, with electricity grids accounting for 24 per cent, the report said.\\n\\nAsia dominates low-carbon energy deployment across all major technologies, accounting for 65 per cent of solar, 64 per cent of wind, 48 per cent of hydrogen, and 41 per cent of battery investment in 2025.\\n“This largely reflects China’s drive for energy independence from oil and gas imports, transiting vulnerable maritime chokepoints, and increasingly contentious supplier nations,” the report said.\\nFossil fuels still provided the bulk of electricity generation globally, but their share was eroding rapidly, it added.\\nAsia is taking the lead in global electrification, with eight of the top 10 countries showing the highest share of electricity in their useful energy mix located in the region, according to Rystad.\\nIt identified Bangladesh, Vietnam, the Philippines and Malaysia among nations which had rapidly advanced electrification, leapfrogging traditional energy systems.\\nThe report provides a ray of hope ahead of the UN Cop30 climate change conference from November 10 to 21 in the Brazilian city of Belem, showing that the effects of climate change can be limited by accelerating national climate goals.\\nElectricity consumption patterns are lopsided as two-thirds of the power source are dominated by just seven countries in the world, with China and the United States among the biggest users.\\nLooking ahead, China is expected to experience the largest absolute growth, adding about 2,400 terawatt hours of demand by 2035 as electrification deepens. India, meanwhile, is projected to record the fastest relative growth, more than doubling its demand as urbanisation and rising incomes reshape lifestyles, according to the Rystad report.\\n\\n\\nIn a separate report released on Thursday by civil society organisations and communities including the Centre for Energy, Ecology, and Development, EarthRights International and Energy Shift Southeast Asia, the groups urged Asean to move away from fossil fuels.\\n“Southeast Asia stands at the forefront of the climate and biodiversity crisis,” the groups said. “Our region – home to the Coral Triangle and some of the world’s richest ecosystems – faces worsening heatwaves, floods, and rising seas. Addressing these crises is no longer optional; it is essential for our collective survival.”\\nThe joint call comes at a time when the Philippines, a climate-vulnerable nation, assumes the chairmanship of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations in 2026, following Malaysia’s term.\\nWith Cop30 approaching, the groups reiterated the need for Southeast Asian governments to align their nationally determined contributions with the 1.5-degree goal.\\nThey also urged Global North countries to urgently deliver climate finance.\\nThe Cop30 conference will be held at a time when the US under President Donald Trump remains largely disengaged from climate challenges, following his successive orders to withdraw the world’s largest economy from the 2015 Paris Agreement.\\n\\nA Lancet report released on Wednesday also underscored the need for the transition, warning that the costs of overreliance on fossil fuels were already taking a toll on health systems and livelihoods, with 13 of 20 indicators tracking health threats reaching unprecedented levels.\\nIt said the warming effects of climate change had seen the rate of heat-related deaths surge 23 per cent since the 1990s, to 546,000 a year, while air pollution from the continued burning of fossil fuels had resulted in a staggering 2.5 million deaths every year.\\n“This Lancet report is a devastating global health audit, and the findings are clear: our addiction to fossil fuels is killing us by the millions,” Harjeet Singh, climate activist and founding director of Satat Sampada Climate Foundation, told This Week in Asia.\\nDependence on fossil fuels also puts an unbearable strain on government budgets, with a total of US$956 billion spent on net fossil fuel subsidies in 2023. This increased financial pressure and dwarfed the US$300 billion a year that the international community committed at Cop29 to tackle climate change worldwide, the Lancet report added.\\n“This is economic self-sabotage. We lost over a trillion dollars globally last year in heat-related labour alone, while governments simultaneously handed nearly a trillion dollars in subsidies to the very industry causing the crisis,” Singh said.\\n“The only solution is to turn off the tap.”\\n",

            "description": "Jensen Huang’s viral meal is driving a sharp rally in South Korea’s fried chicken-related stocks.\\nThe Nvidia CEO shared beers with Samsung Electronics Chair Jay Y. Lee and Hyundai Motor Executive Chair Chung Eui-sun at a local restaurant, Kkanbu Chicken, on Thursday evening.\\nWhile Kkanbu is not publicly listed, shares of rival Kyochon F&amp;B surged as much as 20 per cent on Friday after photos and videos of the gathering circulated widely on social media.\\nSouth Korean poultry processor Cherrybro also soared by the daily limit of 30 per cent, with trading volume about 200 times its average. Neuromeka, a Kosdaq-listed company that makes chicken-frying robots, also soared.\\nThe episode reflects how virality and memes continue to influence South Korea’s stock market, where risk-seeking traders often chase short-term gains tied to cultural, political or economic moments in the spotlight. These rallies, typically in small-cap Kosdaq stocks, are rarely driven by fundamentals and often lack any real link to company operations.\\n\\nIn August, shares of South Korean pen maker MonAmi surged after US leader Donald Trump praised President Lee Jae-myung’s pen during their first in-person meeting at the White House.\\nHuang, in South Korea this week for the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation CEO summit, was seen handing out chicken to a policeman and onlookers gathered outside the restaurant to catch a glimpse of him.\\nIt is not the first time Huang has acted as a stock market kingmaker. In 2024, several AI-related companies saw their shares surge after he name-dropped them during a presentation, showing his influence well beyond his company.\\n",
