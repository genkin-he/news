            "title": "Was Russian jet fly-past a bid to intimidate Japan into cooling ties with US?",
            "description": "A near-incursion of Russian fighter jets into Japanese airspace last week was a bid by Moscow to intimidate Tokyo amid strengthening ties with Washington, observers warned.\\nAnd unless there was a breakthrough in US-Russia relations, it was unlikely that ties between Moscow and Tokyo would thaw even under new Japanese Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi, they said.\\nJapan said it scrambled jets last Friday to monitor Russian warplanes, including strategic bombers capable of carrying nuclear weapons, which had flown along the edge of Japanese airspace up its coast.\\nRussia’s Defence Ministry, in a statement reported by state-owned RIA news agency, confirmed its Tu-95 bombers had been escorted by jets from another country during what it described as a routine patrol flight over neutral waters.\\nThe incident was said to have taken place hours before Takaichi pledged to accelerate Japan’s defence build-up. In her first speech to parliament since taking office, she said Russia’s military activities, along with those of China and North Korea, were posing a “serious concern”.\\n\\nJapan’s Ministry of Defence released a map showing the flight path of the Russian planes off Japan’s west coast over the Sea of Japan. It said the bombers were accompanied by two Su-35 fighters and had initially flown towards Japan’s Sado Island before turning northwards.\\n“Russia conducts daily military operations around our country while invading Ukraine – this is the reality,” new Defence Minister Shinjiro Koizumi wrote in a social media post.\\nYoichiro Sato, a professor of Asia-Pacific studies at Japan’s Ritsumeikan Asia-Pacific University, said while Moscow had previously flown bombers around Japan’s airspace, the timing of last week’s manoeuvre was notable, coming just after Takaichi took office and before she was due to meet US President Donald Trump.\\nRussia is trying to intimidate Japan against enhancing its alliance with the US\\nYoichiro Sato, a professor of Asia-Pacific studies\\n“[This] suggests Russia is trying to intimidate Japan against enhancing its alliance with the US,” Sato said. “This is likely counterproductive, as the domestic public opinion will support stronger defence that Takaichi pursues.”\\nDuring Takaichi’s first summit with Trump on Tuesday, both sides agreed to strengthen the bilateral alliance’s deterrence and response capabilities.\\nTokyo also made clear it would take the initiative in shoring up defence spending.\\nPublic support for increased defence spending in Japan has grown in recent years. A Yomiuri Shimbun poll in April found that 53 per cent of respondents supported the government’s military budget increase.\\n\\nOn Wednesday, Koizumi told his visiting US counterpart, Pete Hegseth, that Japan would raise its defence budget to 2 per cent of its gross domestic product by the end of this financial year, two years ahead of its previous commitment.\\nColder than Abe?\\nAlthough Takaichi was a protege to late Japanese prime minister Shinzo Abe, Sato said she was unlikely to continue with her mentor’s “flirtation” with Russia.\\n“The hardline [position] against Russia, which resulted in Japan’s joining of the western sanctions against Russia during the Fumio Kishida administration, is likely to be maintained by Takaichi,” Sato said.\\nAbe and Russian leader Vladimir Putin met more than two dozen times over the course of the former’s second term as prime minister, from 2012 to 2020.\\nApart from inviting Putin to his hometown of Nagato and attending the opening ceremony of the Sochi Winter Olympics in 2014 amid western leaders’ boycott, Abe also boosted economic ties with Moscow, especially in the Russian Far East.\\n\\n\\nAbe also continued negotiations with Moscow on the disputed islands known as the Northern Territories in Japan and the Southern Kurils in Russia.\\nArtyom Lukin, a professor at Russia’s Far Eastern Federal University in Vladivostok, said Takaichi’s leadership was unlikely to significantly alter Russia-Japan ties.\\n“Political relations between Japan and Russia have already been virtually frozen under the previous prime ministers … Neither Japan nor Russia see each other as foreign policy priorities. It will not change under Takaichi,” Lukin said.\\nTokyo’s behaviour towards Moscow would also depend on the state of relations between the US and Russia, he added. “If Trump makes a deal with Putin, Japan-Russia relations are likely to improve as well. If US-Russia relations deteriorate, Tokyo will follow suit.”\\nTies between Washington and Moscow remain largely adversarial, driven by Russia’s ongoing war in Ukraine, with the US implementing a new round of sanctions targeting Russian oil on October 22.\\nFollowing a phone call with Putin on October 16, Trump announced his intention to meet the Russian leader in Budapest within two weeks to discuss ending the war. But days later, on October 22, Trump called off the planned summit, stating that he did not want a “wasted meeting” or a “waste of time”.\\n\\nLukin said that an important thing to watch was whether the Takaichi government would drastically reduce, or even stop, purchases of Russian liquefied natural gas from Sakhalin.\\n“If it happens, then, the last major economic link between Russia and Japan will be severed. It is not likely to happen in the short term, though,” Lukin predicted.\\nWashington has been urging Tokyo to end Russian energy imports to reinforce sanctions on Moscow over its war against Ukraine that began in 2022.\\nOn Tuesday, Takaichi told Trump that Japan intended to keep importing Russian gas for the time being, warning of the risk of domestic power shortages if imports were stopped, the Japanese media reported, citing government sources.\\nLast year, Russia accounted for 8.6 per cent of Japan’s total imports of liquefied natural gas, which is mainly used for thermal power generation and city gas.\\nThe gas comes from the Sakhalin 2 in the Russian Far East. Two Japanese firms continue to hold stakes in the energy project even after British oil giant Shell withdrew following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.\\nIndia, “intimidated” by Trump’s tariff, was expected to stop new Russian oil purchases and turn to alternative supplies from the Middle East, Sato said. “Japan is not off the hook either.”\\nAdditional reporting by Reuters\\n",

            "title": "Hong Kong’s Halliday eyes Asian Games glory, officials say he can be a world-beater",
            "description": "Newly crowned National Games gold medallist Nicholas Halliday might not know where his next holiday will be, or how to spend his cash prize, but the Hong Kong sailor certainly knows what his next goal is.\\nHalliday secured the ILCA 7 title by demonstrating some serious skills manoeuvring his dinghy in windy conditions around the coastal city of Shanwei over the past few days.\\nAnd on Friday, the 26-year-old said he had some unfinished business with the Asian Games, after finishing fourth in Hangzhou in 2023.\\nSpeaking to the Post at the Royal Hong Kong Yacht Club, Halliday said he “definitely wanted” to do well in Japan next year and also qualify for the LA Olympics in 2028.\\n“It was a bit bitter coming fourth last time,” Halliday said at the event honouring the city’s National Games sailors. “So, to get a medal there [Nagoya], that would be great.\\n“The Olympic qualifiers should be coming around next year. They haven’t announced the specific events yet, but I’d like to qualify for the Olympics again.\\n“This has been an awesome year, I feel like I’ve just been unstoppable. I’ve had some really good regattas and also some not-so-good ones so, next season, I want to be a bit more consistent up there, consistency is really important in sailing.”\\n\\nFirst though, the 26-year-old said he planned to take a break before heading to Greece for a training camp in the middle of November.\\n“I haven’t even thought about where I’m going to go,” he said. “But it’ll probably be really spontaneous and go somewhere outside [of Hong Kong].”\\nThe city’s first medal of any colour at the 2025 Games brought with it a HK$750,000 (US$96,500) bonus as part of the Hong Kong Jockey Club’s incentive scheme for athletes.\\nAsked what he might do with the money, Halliday said he was “not sure”, but maybe fans would “see me at the racecourse next Wednesday, betting on a horse”.\\n“So, let’s see what happens,” he said. “Put it all on red, you know, then maybe I can buy a big boat.”\\nHalliday had not really considered the possibility he might win gold until teammate Peter Jessop said it was sure to happen, and the two-time Asian Games athlete thanked his compatriot for “having a lot of faith in me”.\\n“I wasn’t 100 per cent confident but I knew that if I had a bad race I could catch up, and I think that’s what got me the gold medal in the end,” Halliday said. “I was waiting for them to make the mistakes, and I was just consistently up there.\\n“And eventually some of them did make a big mistake, and I took the win from there.”\\nSenior officials at the Sailing Federation of Hong Kong, China said Halliday’s dedication had been key to his success and believed the confidence he would take from winning would only help him going forwards.\\nPeter Backe, the federation’s vice-president, said Halliday needed to take that confidence as “one of the better sailors in the world now” and turn it into “becoming the absolute top sailor”.\\n“It shouldn’t be a surprise to him to rank in the top three at any of the events around the world now,” Backe said. “Sailing is a very unpredictable sport because there’s so many factors. I don’t want to say too many things about the results but he should easily be fighting for a medal at the Asian Games.”\\n",

            "title": "Washington Halloween displays show scariest thing for Democrats is Trump",
            "description": "In some neighbourhoods of heavily Democratic Washington, Halloween displays with a decidedly political tone have long been a tradition.\\nNine months into Republican US President Donald Trump’s second term, some residents are staging anti-Trump yard displays prompted in part by his administration’s budget cuts, job lay-offs and norm-breaking policies.\\nThis Halloween also coincides with one of the longest government shutdowns in US history.\\nIn a front yard close to the US Capitol, Donna Breslin, 79, has installed an entire graveyard with 16 headstones to mark policy moves Trump has made since he took office in January that she says are killing off American democracy.\\nThere are headstones – bought on Amazon and hand-painted by Breslin – for “USAID” and “research for health and science”, among others.\\n\\nThe headstones are references to Trump administration cuts to the US Agency for International Development and health research, both part of his broader effort to shrink the federal bureaucracy.\\nReuters journalists visited two neighbourhoods in Washington – Georgetown and Capitol Hill, known for their politically themed displays – over two days and did not find any pro-Trump or anti-Democratic Halloween decorations.\\nThe Washington metropolitan area has borne the brunt of Trump’s cuts. Civil servants have been furloughed because of the shutdown with each party blaming the other.\\nIn the city proper, around 90 per cent of voters are registered Democrats.\\nTrump defends the cuts as necessary to reduce a bloated and inefficient workforce. He rejects the notion that his actions test the limits of the presidency and undermine democracy, saying he is simply delivering on his campaign agenda.\\nKush Desai, a White House spokesman, said Democrats were engaged in “pointless virtue signalling” with their anti-Trump Halloween displays.\\n\\nThe White House is also using Halloween to mock its opponents, posting images on social media of costumes depicting Democratic leaders – and a separate one of Trump himself with the message, “Not included – crown.”\\nThis would appear to be a White House effort to make light of the “No Kings” protests by tens of thousands of Americans this month to oppose what they view as authoritarian tendencies in Trump’s leadership.\\nOne focus of this year’s Halloween displays is Trump’s health secretary, Robert F. Kennedy Jnr, who has cut staff at the Department of Health and Human Services and promoted debunked claims that routine childhood vaccines cause harm.\\nIn the wealthy, liberal Northwest Washington neighbourhood of Georgetown, where Kennedy lives, there are multiple skeletons on display in front yards alongside vaccine-related messages.\\nA block from Kennedy’s house stands a giant three-metre-tall (10-foot -tall) skeleton next to a sign that reads, “Hi, I’m Wally! Vaccines save lives – believe me I know!”\\n\\nKennedy has restricted access to Covid-19 shots, boosted support for state vaccine exemptions, dismantled the vaccine review process, and expanded a national advisory board with like-minded critics of Covid shots.\\nAn HHS spokesman said in a statement, “Let’s be clear: Secretary Kennedy is not anti-vaccine – he is pro-safety, pro-transparency, and pro-accountability. His long-standing advocacy has focused on ensuring that vaccines and all medical interventions meet the highest standards of safety and are backed by gold standard science.”\\nIn another Georgetown front yard, a skeleton dangles over a fence with a stethoscope around its neck, next to a sign reading, “Secretary of Sick”.\\nClose to Kennedy’s house, Christine Payne, 66, has placed a child-sized skeleton in her front window with the message, “Wish I had taken my vaccine!”\\nPayne said while she didn’t agree with his policies, Kennedy was a good neighbour.\\n“I think we all need to speak out with what’s going on in this nation at the moment, especially in Washington,” Payne said. “We’re very political here.”\\n",

            "title": "European private equity firm Ardian eyes fresh growth at new office in Hong Kong’s Two IFC",
            "description": "Paris-based private equity (PE) firm Ardian has opened a 4,000 sq ft office in Hong Kong’s main business district, with an eye on growing its US$3 billion investment out of the company’s total US$200 billion in assets under management (AUM).\\nThe new office at the Two International Finance Centre in Central marked the company’s fifth location in Asia and would initially have eight permanent staff, according to Jason Yao, the group’s head of Greater China.\\n“The reason we have an office here is to be close to our investors,” Yao said in an interview with the Post on Thursday. “We have very important insurance companies that have already committed to our various products. To be close to clients is one thing we want to develop in Hong Kong.”\\n“Private wealth is also a big topic in our industry as a source of capital. Investment-wise it is very important for the secondary business,” Yao added. “So we have a lot of sellers here and we have most of the intermediaries, the investment bank side, also here. It’s also very critical for us to further expand our secondary business in the region.”\\nArdian, one of the largest European-headquartered PE firms, is considered one of the leading investors in the secondary private market, which involves the buying and selling of existing investments from other investors.\\nIt has about 50 long-standing clients in the Greater China region. Its investors include insurance firms, sovereign wealth funds, private wealth investors and endowments.\\nThe company’s expansion reflected robust growth in Hong Kong’s private banking and wealth management sectors, as well as an evolving office property market that is contending with slower demand amid plenty of new completed prime office buildings.\\nMajor private banks’ AUM in Hong Kong rose 14 per cent in the first half of the year compared with the end of December, while they hired more than 400 wealth management experts in the past two years, an increase of 12 per cent, according to Eddie Yue Wai-man, the Chief Executive of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority. Some of these banks also expanded their office space.\\n\\nMeanwhile, 17.1 per cent of the city’s prime offices were empty as of the third quarter, according to data compiled by consultancy CBRE. The number of empty offices is likely to hit a record 19 per cent by the end of the year.\\nThat development comes as the banking and finance sector further reduced its office footprint in Hong Kong by 70,000 sq ft of net floor area between 2022 and 2025, following a significant 680,000 sq ft contraction in the preceding three years, CBRE said.\\nFirms from the US, Europe, Middle East and Africa reduced their total footprint by 1.3 million sq ft from 2022 to 2025, which was a smaller decline than the 2.7 million sq ft drop seen from 2019 to 2022, the consultancy added.\\nOn a positive development, the Hong Kong stock market has topped the global rankings for initial public offerings, as 66 companies raised US$23.27 billion on the main board in the first nine months of this year.\\nIn addition, the government has remained aggressive in attracting affluent investors in the city via its cash-for-residency scheme.\\nBefore the opening of Ardian’s new office in Central, Yao said the company would serve Hong Kong-based clients from its Beijing office.\\n“It makes more sense to be based here instead of flying in and out of Hong Kong every week,” he said, adding that Ardian planned to hire seven new recruits by next year.\\nIt also helped that office rental prices in Hong Kong have fallen as the group committed to a long-term lease for its space in Central.\\n“The rent is much better than we expected,” he said. “We’re very lucky as we signed last November and I consider that timing to probably be the bottom of the market.”\\nThere was a lot of potential for Ardian to grow investments from Hong Kong-based clients, even doubling them by next year, he said.\\nArdian considered establishing an office in Hong Kong even before the Covid-19 pandemic, but had to defer the plan owing to social distancing measures and the search for a suitable space.\\n“Hong Kong’s Central is unparalleled,” he said. “Nowhere else can you find in such a small [central business] area, where you have all your peers, all the investment banks, all the lawyers, all very concentrated in one super efficient location.”\\n“We also like the (Victoria Harbour) view.”\\nAs for some companies, either downsizing operations in Hong Kong or leaving the city, Yao said these cases typically made a lot of noise. Ardian, however, viewed them as a “natural transition”, he added.\\n“You always have people coming and going,” he said. “As a European firm, we always watch out for opportunities in Hong Kong. We are committed and we want to be here in the next 20 to 30 years.”\\n",

            "title": "Can ancient monastery in Mount Sinai, Egypt, cope with massive increase in tourism?",
            "description": "St Catherine’s Monastery, located at the foot of Mount Sinai in Egypt and known for its sacred peace, is now preparing to open up to the public.\\nThe Greek Orthodox monastery was founded in the 6th century and is one of the world’s oldest continuously inhabited Christian monasteries.\\nMoses is said to have received the 10 Commandments on Mount Sinai.\\nThis 1,500-year-old monastery was built where the valley ends and Mount Sinai begins.\\nKnown among the faithful for housing relics of St Catherine of Alexandria, its ancient library of rare manuscripts also draws many pilgrims.\\nGentle breezes blow across barren, reddish-brown rocks, causing rose bushes and olive trees to flutter.\\n\\nSpend a few days here, and what you mostly sense is silence.\\nChristians, Jews and Muslims revere this place, where faith, history and nature all come together in a powerful combination.\\nBut down in the valley, it is bustling with concrete, containers and construction vehicles as today’s Egypt prepares for tomorrow’s tourism.\\nHotels and villas are planned, offering upwards of 1,000 rooms plus a promenade with a bazaar, a Peace Plaza and a visitor centre. The sign is already in place.\\nThe government is celebrating the construction project, which is scheduled for completion in October 2026, as “Egypt’s gift to the whole world and all religions”.\\nA museum and theatre are planned, as well as conference rooms and restaurants. Motorways are being paved and a currently unused airport nearby is being expanded. It is set to cost US$220 million.\\nIt will be a “wonderful destination for all visitors”, whether they come for religious reasons, recreation or nature, says Egyptian Prime Minister Mostafa Madbouly.\\nAccording to state-affiliated media, the aim is to “harness the magic of the region” and transform it into a “must-visit destination”. A large German hotel chain is already on board.\\n\\nBut can a monastery that thrives on peace and seclusion cope with so many visitors? Will not a religious site with a few occasional tourists then become a tourist site with a few religious attractions?\\nA “delicate balance” is needed, says Father Justin, one of 22 monks living in St Catherine’s Monastery. “Open and accessible to a certain extent, but also preserving quiet times and solitude.”\\nThe monks begin their day at 4am and live in line with a “complex schedule that has been in place for centuries”, Father Justin says. The monastery opens to visitors for three hours a day at present. But change is coming. The project represents “the greatest possible contrast to what the area stands for”, according to World Heritage Watch, an organisation dedicated to protecting Unesco World Heritage sites. The area received this status in 2002.\\nUnesco has called on the government in Cairo to present a protection plan, halt the construction work and let observers into the country, but so far, nothing has come of this.\\nThe Bedouin have long been faced with a new reality. Members of the Jabaliya tribe, said to be descended from Byzantine soldiers sent in the 6th century to guard the monastery, are believed to be the oldest tribe in the area. The name “Jabaliya” comes from the Arabic word for “mountain”.\\nThey made the construction and operation of the monastery possible in the first place, acting as protectors, mountain guides and camel drivers. Now, their houses have been demolished during the construction work, and an old cemetery has been destroyed. With their bare hands, they dug up the remains of their relatives to bury them further away. Where the cemetery used to be is now a car park.\\n“They ignore everyone,” says one of the Bedouin of the government’s activities.\\nSt Catherine’s Monastery is in danger of becoming like Sharm el-Sheikh, further south – a place with “five-star hotels and tourists who only stay in their hotels”.\\n\\nAfter being forced into the hinterland in Sharm, many Bedouin make their living from waste recycling.\\nOn Mount Sinai, everything appears to be the same as ever. For some, after a laborious climb, all the energy of St Catherine is released.\\nA Korean tour group is singing Christian songs, and a woman sobs loudly as she says a prayer at the summit. Another sits quietly crying on a rock, watching the sunset.\\nDown in the monastery, the singing of the monks can be heard coming from a loudspeaker in the small shop, and the smell of burning wax from the votive candles fills the air.\\nA few rooms above, the library houses more than 3,300 ancient manuscripts.\\n“You have to protect the people who come here to feel something inside themselves,” says a monk. “Something in their hearts. If you don’t protect it, it becomes a tourist attraction,” he says, placing both hands on his chest.\\n",

            "description": "The sluggish property market has made government land sales more difficult. With the economy still volatile and public confidence fragile, developers and homebuyers are understandably cautious when making investment decisions. Officials should monitor market sentiment closely and adjust relevant policies accordingly in a prudent and timely manner. If the latest residential property prices are any reference, the market has apparently bottomed out.\\nData from the Rating and Valuation Department shows that lived-in home prices rose 1.3 per cent in September, logging the biggest gains so far this year and reaching the highest in more than a year. The increase marks the sixth consecutive month in which the official index has either remained stable or edged higher. Similarly, the Land Registry recorded 78 first-hand residential sales priced between HK$30 million (US$3.86 million) and HK$49.99 million in the first 20 days of October, a 10-month high in transactions involving upmarket deals.\\nConsidering residential prices had fallen 28.4 per cent as of March this year, from their peak in September 2021, the rebound came as a much-needed boost in confidence. The upturn was mainly attributed to a favourable view of easing in interest rates and a resurgence in the recent performance of the local stock market. But whether the optimism is spilling over to the commercial market and the wider economy remains to be seen.\\nSecretary for Development Bernadette Linn Hon-ho said it was likely that commercial land sales would be suspended for the second year because of a lack of market demand. This followed a moratorium early this year to allow the market to absorb the existing supply. The minister said supply remained abundant, adding that the government would not earn any land premium if tenders failed amid a lukewarm market response.\\nThat may be true, but the government cannot sit back until the property market has fully recovered. With so many massive development projects in the pipeline, the government must stay ahead of the market and adjust its policies so as to facilitate timely business decisions. This is not only in the interest of the market but also for the sake of land revenues and public fiscal health.\\n",

            "description": "Leading artificial intelligence models from the United States and China are “highly sycophantic”, and their excessive flattery may make users less likely to repair interpersonal conflicts, a new study has found.\\nThe study by researchers at Stanford University and Carnegie Mellon University published earlier this month tested how 11 large language models (LLMs) responded to user queries seeking advice on personal matters, including cases involving manipulation and deception.\\nIn AI circles, sycophancy is the phenomenon of chatbots excessively agreeing with users. DeepSeek’s V3, released in December 2024, was found to be one of the most sycophantic models, affirming users’ actions 55 per cent more than humans, compared with an average of 47 per cent more for all models.\\nTo establish the human baseline, one of the techniques the researchers used was based on posts from a Reddit community called “Am I The A**hole”, where users post about their interpersonal dilemmas to ask for the community’s opinion about which party is at fault.\\n\\nThe researchers used posts where community members judged the author of the post to be in the wrong to test whether the LLMs, when given the same scenarios, would align with this predominantly English-speaking online group of humans.\\nOn this test, Alibaba Cloud’s Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct, released in January, was found to be the most sycophantic model, contradicting the community verdict – siding with the poster – 79 per cent of the time. The second highest was DeepSeek-V3, which did so in 76 per cent of cases.\\nIn comparison, the least sycophantic model, Google DeepMind’s Gemini-1.5, contradicted the community verdict in 18 per cent of cases. The research has not been peer-reviewed.\\nAlibaba Cloud is the AI and cloud computing unit of Alibaba Group Holding, owner of the Post.\\nThe Qwen and DeepSeek models were the two Chinese models tested, with the others being developed by US firms OpenAI, Anthropic, Google DeepMind and Meta Platforms, and French company Mistral.\\nThe issue of AI sycophancy gained widespread attention in April when OpenAI’s update to ChatGPT made the chatbot noticeably more obsequious. The company said at the time that the behaviour raised legitimate concerns surrounding users’ mental health and pledged to improve pre-deployment evaluations of sycophancy for future releases.\\nIn the latest study, published as a preprint, the US researchers also tested the impact of sycophancy on users and found that sycophantic responses reduced their inclination to resolve conflicts amicably. Users rated sycophantic responses as higher quality and trusted the sycophantic models more.\\n“These preferences create perverse incentives both for people to increasingly rely on sycophantic AI models and for AI model training to favour sycophancy,” the researchers wrote.\\nAI sycophancy has implications for businesses too, according to Jack Jiang, an innovation and information management professor at the University of Hong Kong’s business school and director of its AI Evaluation Lab.\\n“It’s not safe if a model constantly agrees with a business analyst’s conclusion, for instance,” he said.\\n",

            "description": "Hong Kong could host a clash between Australian rugby league giants South Sydney Rabbitohs and English side St Helens in 2027, if officials from both clubs have their way.\\nSt Helens chairman Eamonn McManus, who played rugby union for Hong Kong, has thrown his considerable influence behind the idea, which would form part of a groundbreaking global round of matches being considered by the NRL in Australia.\\nAnd McManus has reportedly been backed by Blake Solly, CEO of the Rabbitohs, who are sponsored by MG Motor, which is owned by the Chinese car company SAIC Motor.\\nWhile officials in Hong Kong said they had yet to be approached by anyone about the plan, which would see Kai Tak Stadium host one of several games to be played worldwide to start the 2027 season, there was considerable enthusiasm for it among those running sport in the city.\\nAs there has been from McManus, who told Australian newspaper The Age that he had “been pushing Hong Kong for 25 years”.\\n\\n“In the first instance I was pushing it as a venue for the World Cup Challenge,” said McManus, who lived in the city for 20 years. “It just seemed like the natural place to go … and now they’ve got a fantastic new stadium. It’s always been a venue that is open to international sporting events. Obviously, they have the Hong Kong Sevens. The NFL have even played there historically.\\n“The relevant government bodies of the Hong Kong tourist association, trade and commerce, they have historically contributed significant sums to such events. We don’t want to create a circus, but what we should be having is strategic locations and select clubs and select games to hold during the course of the year without undermining our bread and butter: Super League and NRL seasons.”\\nThe global round is an ambitious plan to launch the 2027 season with nine matches in different cities around the world, including London, Dubai and Hong Kong.\\nDriven by Peter V’landys, the Australian Rugby League Commission chairman, one of the options is the potential of almost 24 hours of non-stop rugby league action from around the world, with games in France, Hawaii and Las Vegas, where the Rabbitohs played the Manly Sea Eagles last year, being mooted as part of the plan.\\n“There’s still a lot of work to be done, and we don’t have a huge amount of detail, but we’re very interested in Hong Kong,” Solly told The Age.\\n“Eamonn [McManus] has great contacts and understanding of Hong Kong from his time there. If there was an opportunity to work with St Helens on that game, we’d be very happy to work with Eamonn, Mike Rush [CEO] and the team at St Helens.”\\n",

            "description": "Israel said Thursday that it had identified the remains of hostages Amiram Kuper and Sahar Baruch, whose bodies were returned by Hamas earlier in the day.\\nA statement from Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s office said the families of the deceased men had been informed after “completion of the identification process by the National Institute of Forensic Medicine”.\\nMilitants took 251 people hostage during Hamas’s attack on Israel on October 7, 2023, which triggered the war in Gaza.\\nSahar Baruch was taken from kibbutz Beeri to Gaza and killed during a failed army rescue operation two months later. He was 25 when he died.\\nAmiram Kuper, 84 at the time of his abduction, was kidnapped with his wife Nourit Kuper from their home in kibbutz Nir Oz. Israel announced his death in captivity in June 2024.\\nMilitants have so far returned the remains of 17 of the 28 deceased hostages that Hamas had agreed to hand over as part of a US-brokered truce deal with Israel.\\n\\nIn a statement, the Hostages and Missing Families Forum, a campaign group, expressed its support for the families of Kuper and Baruch, and called for the return of the bodies of the remaining dead hostages.\\nIsrael launched a wave of strikes on Gaza overnight from Tuesday to Wednesday after an attack that left an Israeli soldier dead in the south of the Palestinian territory.\\nGaza’s civil defence agency, which operates as a rescue force under Hamas authority, said the strikes killed more than 100 people, including dozens of children, in the worst night of bombing since the truce went into effect on October 10.\\nBy Wednesday morning, Israel said it had begun “renewed enforcement of the ceasefire”, and both US President Donald Trump and regional mediator Qatar said they expected it to hold.\\nHamas has said its fighters had “no connection to the shooting incident in Rafah” and reaffirmed its commitment to the truce.\\nIt also delayed handing over what it said were the remains of a deceased hostage, adding that any “escalation will hinder the search, excavation and recovery of the bodies”.\\nThe militant group drew outrage in Israel on Monday after it returned the partial remains of a previously recovered captive, which Israel said was a breach of the truce.\\nHamas had said the remains were the 16th body it had agreed to return, but Israeli forensic examination determined they were in fact partial remains of a hostage whose body had already been brought back to Israel around two years ago, according to the prime minister’s office.\\nAfter the start of this month’s ceasefire, the group returned the 20 surviving captives still in its custody and began the process of returning the bodies of the dead hostages.\\nIsrael accuses Hamas of reneging on the deal by not returning them quickly enough, but the Palestinian group says it will take time to locate remains buried in Gaza’s ruins.\\n",

            "title": "Xi-Trump summit breakthroughs are a net positive for China",
            "description": "Relations between the world’s two biggest economies urgently need to be stabilised. Not for the first time has it taken a face-to-face meeting between leaders to try to keep them on track. Thursday’s summit in South Korea between Chinese President Xi Jinping and US President Donald Trump reins in a sustained escalation of trade and political tensions. They made breakthroughs on some thorny bilateral issues.\\n“We have a deal,” Trump proclaimed afterwards. The world will be relieved if the deal clears the way for a more stable, predictable geopolitical environment. It has to be welcomed as a significant breakthrough, considering how fraught relations have become under the Trump administration’s escalation of the trade war with tariffs and tech export curbs.\\nOverall, the summit is a positive result for China that meets realistic expectations, given the deep and structural bilateral issues. Trump has backed down again from his threat of 100 per cent additional tariffs on China over curbs on rare earth exports, which removes a big source of uncertainty and potential risk for markets.\\nA tariff intended to combat fentanyl trafficking to the United States will be reduced from 20 to 10 per cent; this includes Hong Kong and Macau. On other issues, such as shipping and port restrictions, they agreed to suspend the measures for a year – a truce that could help cooler heads prevail. The language on US chip exports and Chinese rare earth exports is vague – it is not surprising that such complex issues cannot be quickly resolved.\\nTrump finalised his proposed visit to Beijing in April. This is very important. He probably will want to wait until then to reveal more deals – if the two sides can reach them. Hopefully, it means that until April there will be political will on both sides to keep things stable.\\nTaiwan was not mentioned, at least in public. That is good for Beijing, which is under no illusion that the US and Western countries will support it over Taiwan. The best it can hope for is that they will largely leave the Taiwan issue to Beijing, to be treated as China’s own affair. In the past, the US president mentioned Taiwan partly as a political gesture and partly as an example for other Western countries. Now, if Trump drops the topic – at least in public – it will make it harder for other Western countries to raise it with Beijing. That is a plus for China.\\nGiven Trump’s style and capacity for backflipping, it may not be plain sailing ahead for bilateral relations. Ultimately, both sides stand to win by keeping ties cordial. Xi echoed this sentiment, according to Xinhua, with his remark to Trump that China and the US should focus on the long-term benefits of cooperation, not get “caught in a vicious cycle of mutual retaliation”.\\n",
