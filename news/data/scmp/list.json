            "title": "After Xi-Trump talks, lack of semiconductor deal seen as tech-independence issue",
            "description": "Amid the apparent absence of a concrete deal being reached with Washington on one of Beijing’s long-standing points of trade contention – export controls on the most advanced semiconductors – analysts say it reflects China’s increasing resolve to become more independent from the US.\\nAfter a meeting with President Xi Jinping in South Korea on Thursday morning, US President Donald Trump said the two sides “did discuss chips”.\\n“China is going to be talking to Nvidia and others about taking chips … and I’ll be speaking to Jensen [Huang] from Nvidia,” Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One, referring to the world’s top chip designer and its CEO.\\n“I said that’s really between [China] and Nvidia, but we are sort of the arbitrator or the referee,” Trump added.\\nHis comments came as the two sides announced progress on other issues, including tariff reductions and pauses; rare earth export controls; agricultural purchases; and suspensions of port fees.\\nHowever, experts caution that these concessions should not be mistaken for fundamental shifts in the strategic rivalry between Washington and Beijing. Instead, they represent tactical moves by both sides to buy time and manage vulnerabilities, according to Junyu Tan, a regional economist for North Asia with credit insurance company Coface.\\n“For China, this means accelerating efforts to reduce its reliance on the US for advanced chip technologies,” Tan said.\\nWe’re seeing a big push and pull between the economic and security voices in the US administration\\nNick Marro, Economist Intelligence Unit\\nKnowing that the loosening of controls on semiconductors is a key ask from Beijing, Trump has shown a willingness to compromise on the issue, observed Nick Marro, principal economist for Asia and the lead for global trade at the Economist Intelligence Unit. But he added that the US national security establishment and Congress, across party lines, have been opposed to any easing in US policy.\\n“We’re seeing a big push and pull between the economic and security voices in the US administration,” he said. “The administration will have to strike a fine line balancing these competing views.”\\nBut all of this is now complicated by the fact that China is also becoming less restrained in the sector, Marro explained.\\n“For years, Chinese officials have issued guidance – both explicit and implicit – for local companies to cut American products out of their supply chains,” he said. “But now the message seems more urgent, and more forceful.”\\nThe Trump administration has vacillated on allowing Nvidia’s advanced chips into China, uncertain of whether it would create dependency or boost China’s military and tech sectors.\\nAfter briefly banning sales of Nvidia’s China-specific H20 AI chip, the US lifted the ban as part of rare earth negotiations in July.\\n\\n\\nLater, however, Chinese regulators reportedly ordered leading technology companies to halt purchases of those chips, with Beijing launching antitrust investigations into Nvidia while raising questions about security risks.\\nNvidia’s Huang said on Tuesday that his company had not applied for US export licences to send its newest chips to China, because of the Chinese position.\\n“They’ve made it very clear that they don’t want Nvidia to be there right now,” he said during the company’s developers’ event.\\nWang Dan, China director at Eurasia Group, said the 15th five-year plan that Beijing just formulated made it particularly clear that the country would focus on “original innovation”, meaning China realised that buying US chips was unsustainable and unreliable, even if short-term imports were possible and might address immediate needs.\\n“Therefore, China is now directing more resources towards achieving breakthroughs,” Wang said.\\nAs for negotiations with the US in the long run, China is also unlikely to make excessive concessions if the US temporarily relaxes chip-export controls at some point, she added.\\n“I don’t think China will entirely lift its rare earth controls just because the US rolls back a small portion of its chip restrictions.”\\n",

            "description": "South Korean President Lee Jae-myung and Japan’s new Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi both stressed on Thursday the importance of “forward-looking ties” as they held their first official talks.\\nRelations have long suffered over issues related to Japan’s brutal 1910-45 occupation of the Korean peninsula, and there have been concerns that ties could worsen under Takaichi.\\n“In today’s rapidly changing international and trade environment, South Korea and Japan – as neighbouring countries with so many commonalities – must strengthen forward-looking cooperation more than ever before,” Lee told Takaichi at the meeting.\\nThe Japanese leader, meanwhile, said there were “certain issues we disagree on precisely because we’re neighbours”.\\n“We agreed that we should exercise our leadership to take care of them, and develop our relationships in a future-oriented, stable manner,” said Takaichi, who took office last week.\\nThe meeting took place at an Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (Apec) summit in Gyeongju, South Korea, that was also attended by Chinese leader Xi Jinping and, until Thursday, US President Donald Trump.\\n\\nWar criminals\\nBefore being elected, Takaichi, an acolyte of late ex-premier Shinzo Abe – whose relations with Seoul were terrible – regularly visited the Yasukuni Shrine.\\nThe site honours Japanese killed in combat, including convicted war criminals, and has long dogged Tokyo’s relations with both Seoul and Beijing.\\nTakaichi, 64, has appeared to have toned down her nationalist image, staying away from a recent festival at Yasukuni and sending an offering instead.\\nAfter being elected, she said that she wanted to stabilise ties and likes “Korean seaweed, use Korean cosmetics and watch Korean dramas”.\\nSouth Korea’s former conservative president Yoon Suk-yeol sought to improve relations with Japan.\\nLee, who takes a relatively more dovish approach than Yoon towards North Korea, has said South Korea and Japan are like “neighbours sharing a front yard”.\\n“Caught between the US and China, Japan and South Korea have little choice but to cooperate, and both leaders are well aware of that,” said Lee Jae-mook, political science professor at the Hankuk University of Foreign Studies.\\n“The concern, however, is that when their approval ratings fall, leaders in both countries tend to use Seoul-Tokyo relations for domestic political gain – through right-wing gestures like visits to the Yasukuni Shrine, for instance,” he said.\\nPolitical commentator Park Sang-byung said Lee “cannot, and will not, side with Japan the way Yoon Suk-yeol did”.\\n“The best-case scenario is that things don’t deteriorate – that Takaichi doesn’t fully embrace the far-right, Abe-style approach, or blindly take Washington’s side in every trilateral issue despite the existing US-Japan-South Korea cooperation,” he said.\\n",

            "title": "Gone are the days of unlimited US power in Southeast Asia",
            "description": "The arrival of United States President Donald Trump in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, may appear to be a routine diplomatic gesture, but it carries far greater symbolic weight. His visit marks a turning point in Washington’s struggle to remain relevant in a world where its power no longer defines the terms of engagement.\\nFor decades, Asia listened when America spoke. Today, it still listens, but it no longer obeys.\\nThe Association of Southeast Asian Nations (Asean) was born in an era when the Global South sought autonomy from the rival blocs of the Cold War. Trump’s presence at Asean underscores how dramatically global and regional dynamics have shifted. The US, once the centre of gravity, now orbits around new constellations of power.\\nWhile the US has engaged with Asean for decades, former US president Joe Biden was notably absent from major summits after his second year in office, only attending one in-person summit after Covid-19. Trump himself lost interest in the bloc during his first term, skipping all major meetings after 2017.\\nWashington’s willingness to re-engage Asean, on the bloc’s own terms, is not a gesture of generosity, but an act of necessity, perhaps evidenced by the signing of rare earths deals with Malaysia and Thailand.\\nThe US can no longer afford to ignore a grouping that represents one of the fastest-growing regions in the world, one increasingly setting its own agenda on trade, technology and security. For Southeast Asia, Trump’s visit is less about nostalgia for American leadership and more about a pragmatic opportunity to balance between global superpowers without taking sides.\\n\\nAfter years of frustration in the Middle East, Washington is quietly conceding that its grand projects there have failed to deliver. The withdrawal from Afghanistan and an effective stalemate in Iraq have exposed the limits of American reach. Even the 12-day war launched by Israel against Iran with American backing and participation failed to meet its objectives: it did not eliminate Iran’s nuclear capabilities nor triggered regime change.\\nIn this vacuum, the emerging partnership among Iran, China and Russia has altered the balance of global power. It is no longer possible for Washington to dictate outcomes in the region or completely isolate Tehran through sanctions or coercion. What was once called “containment” now looks more like self-containment, a narrowing of American influence amid expanding Eurasian alliances.\\nMeanwhile, China’s Belt and Road Initiative continues to knit together a new economic geography from Central Asia to the Indian Ocean. Russia’s energy corridors and Iran’s growing connectivity to South and East Asia have created an infrastructure of interdependence that even sanctions can’t fully disrupt. Against this backdrop, Asean’s quiet rise looks less like an exception and more like a frontier of this multipolar momentum.\\nTrump’s visit to Malaysia, a symbolic bid to restore US leverage, reveals the changing reality of American power in Asia but also exposes the limits of American ambitions.\\n\\nThe US can no longer dictate the rules of the regional game; it must play by them. Even close partners like Singapore and Indonesia are hedging against American unpredictability, deepening their economic and security ties with China while continuing cooperation with the West.\\nIn trade, the US is no longer the dominant actor. Its withdrawal from the Trans-Pacific Partnership left a vacuum quickly filled by frameworks like the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership, which even includes US allies. Washington’s absence in rule-setting processes has forced it into a reactive posture. Trump’s trip isn’t about shaping Asia’s future. It’s about catching up to it.\\nThis is where Trump’s transactional style might find its true test. His approach of “deals, not doctrines” resonates with leaders who view politics through the lens of negotiation rather than ideology. However, deal-making requires credibility, something Washington lacks after years of policy reversals.\\nFor much of the post-war era, US diplomacy was about defining rules, institutions and legitimacy. Now, Washington is learning to operate within a system it no longer fully controls. The symbolism of showing up for the first time in years is twofold: it signals Washington’s desire to remain relevant while also acknowledging that relevance must be earned, not assumed.\\n\\nAsia, meanwhile, has grown comfortable with complexity. Countries once anxious about choosing between Beijing and Washington pursue what scholars call “multi-alignment”, engaging all sides while committing to none. It’s a quiet revolution in regional strategy that marks the end of unilateralism. Power today flows through networks, not hierarchies.\\nFor Asean, this evolving power balance has a practical meaning: agency. The bloc’s members have learned to use their collective weight to mediate rather than submit and invite rather than align. The real story of Trump’s Malaysia visit is not a return of US leadership, but the normalisation of Asian autonomy.\\nTrump’s visit is not a comeback; it’s a confession that the age of commanding the world from a position of unchallenged authority is over. The future of global politics from Tehran to Kuala Lumpur to Caracas will be negotiated, not imposed.\\nThe US can lead, but leadership today demands humility just as much as ambition. In the halls of Asean, where postcolonial nations built a platform for mutual respect and restraint, Trump’s presence is a reminder that the balance of power has shifted, not towards chaos, but towards pluralism.\\nThe world no longer revolves around Washington. Yet if the US can learn to participate rather than dominate, it may discover that influence in the 21st century comes not from commanding others but from understanding them.\\n",

            "description": "Police in Shenzhen, the technology hub in southern China’s Guangdong province, have smashed a syndicate selling counterfeit imported chips to mainland manufacturers, according to local media, exposing an underground market for high-end semiconductors amid US export controls.\\nThe syndicate’s modus operandi was to collect discarded chips, which were laser-polished and relabelled, and sold as imported products from Infineon Technologies, Texas Instruments and Analog Devices, according to a report last week by domestic online media Rule-of-law China.\\nShenzhen police on Thursday confirmed the report, but declined to provide further details.\\nMembers of the group posed as European agents who targeted local manufacturers of car electronics and industrial control systems, according to the report, which also indicated that the fake chips were prone to malfunctions and could pose safety risks.\\nThe syndicate established multiple shell companies that churned out and sold the fake chips in a purported “made-to-order” production model, and had conducted the scam multiple times, the report said.\\nPublic security authorities in Shenzhen’s Nanshan district, which covers the southwest area of the Shenzhen Special Economic Zone, had worked with local market regulators for four months since June before they were able to bust the counterfeit ring and arrest one member, according to the report.\\nThis marked China’s first major criminal case against fake imported chips, the report said. Shenzhen authorities have also established a traceability mechanism with international chipmakers, it added.\\n\\nLocal demand for bogus chip imports reflects the tight domestic supply of foreign-made semiconductors amid US tech export restrictions, which has also resulted in a thriving black market for the illicit procurement of high-end integrated circuits.\\nChina’s massive demand for advanced semiconductors to power artificial intelligence development projects has created a fast-growing market for smuggled graphics processing units (GPUs), such as Nvidia’s A100 and H100 chips.\\nAt least US$1 billion worth of Nvidia’s GPUs were shipped to China in the three months after US President Donald Trump tightened chip export controls, as the Blackwell architecture-based B200 emerged as the most sought-after imported AI chip in the domestic black market, according to a July report by The Financial Times.\\nAlthough German chipmaker Infineon, along with US firms Texas Instruments and Analog Devices, mostly focused on supplying mature-node chips used in the automotive and lower-end industrial manufacturing sectors, some of their products have remained subject to US export controls.\\nThe Shenzhen syndicate bust comes a month after Beijing tightened its scrutiny against the US legacy chip suppliers.\\nIn September, China’s Ministry of Commerce launched an anti-dumping investigation into imported American analogue chips. It said these US chip suppliers had “lowered and suppressed the sales prices of domestic products” over the past few years.\\nUS authorities, meanwhile, had secretly put location-tracking devices in shipments of advanced chips they suspected of being at high risk of illegal diversion to China, according to a Reuters report in August, citing people with direct knowledge of the matter.\\nIn the same month, US authorities arrested two Chinese nationals on charges that they sent tens of millions of dollars&apos; worth of Nvidia-designed AI chips to China. They were charged with violating the Export Control Reform Act and could face 20 years in prison, according to the US Justice Department.\\n",

            "description": "Tom McKibbin set the Link Hong Kong Open alight on Thursday, firing a course record 10-under-par 60 on a day of low scores in Fanling.\\nThe Northern Irishman’s eight birdies and one eagle left him a shot short of the magical 59 that Patrick Reed produced on his way to winning last year on the Hong Kong Golf Club’s composite course.\\nJazz Janewattananond carded a 61 to sit alone in second, with Kiradech Aphibarnrat, Louis Oosthuizen and Thomas Pieters tied for third at eight under.\\nJust three shots separated the top 10, with Hong Kong amateur Jeffrey Shen Wang-ngai producing a stunning seven-under 63 to sit alongside the likes of International Series Rankings leader Scott Vincent and LIV Golf’s Matt Jones.\\n“It was obviously a very, very good round,” McKibbin said. “I didn’t really miss too many shots, holed a few nice putts and took advantage of the two par-fives that there are out there. And yes, 60 shots later, I’m sitting here.”\\n\\nAs well as a course record, it was a personal one too, with McKibbin never having gone lower than 62 before Thursday. Matching Reed was never really on the cards either, despite the 22-year-old, who started his day on the 11th hole, being six under by the time he got to the 18th tee.\\n“I looked at the scorecard after 17 holes and saw it was a par 70, so I knew I had to eagle the last [par-four 10th], so maybe that helped,” McKibbin said. “But yes, 60 is the lowest round that I have ever shot – 62 has been my best before. So it was nice to break that, fantastic.”\\nReed’s historic effort came with preferred lies in place, meaning it was not officially recognised as the lowest round ever produced over the 18 holes, which comprises parts of the club’s New and Eden courses.\\nThat honour had remained with Aaron Rai, who shot a 61 in the second round on the way to winning in 2018.\\nShen, meanwhile, was back in the clubhouse in an early tie for second before most players had even got to the course.\\n\\n“Everything is going well, and I built my confidence in the practice round because I didn’t play well last week,” Shen said. “My dad caddied for me, so we did a pretty good job. He just wanted me to keep it simple.\\n“I mean, I like this feeling, with my family and my friends here to support me, and because this is my home course, every time I feel really good here. At Hong Kong Golf Club, it is all about the putting. So you need to plan for it, because the pin position is changed every day.”\\nShen’s performance also erased the disappointment he endured last week at the Asia-Pacific Amateur Championship in Dubai.\\nA 20ft putt for birdie on the 18th – one of nine he managed in the first round – helped Shen forget the woes of a week in the Middle East when he ended up in hospital twice with heatstroke.\\n“I had a couple of big tournaments coming up, so I tried so hard the last two months,” he said. “I just needed rest. So I just slept a lot and now this. It’s amazing.”\\nShen had a day he will never forget, and so did fellow Hongkonger Taichi Kho, but not for the right reasons. Kho produced the worst round of the day, a seven-over 77 that left him rooted to the bottom of the leaderboard.\\nBetween the two National Games teammates, their compatriots enjoyed varying degrees of success. Jason Hak Shun-yat was the next best at four under, with Isaac Lam two shots further back and Matthew Cheung at one over. Closer to Kho than Shen were Leon D’Souza and Michael Wong on three over, with Terrence Ng at five over.\\n",

            "title": "Trump hails ‘great success’ after talks with Xi raise hopes of easing US-China tensions",
            "description": "China and the United States have reached a truce on thorny issues ranging from soybeans and rare earths to fentanyl, following Thursday’s meeting between Presidents Xi Jinping and Donald Trump in South Korea.\\nTrump hailed the talks at the Gimhae Air Base in Busan as a “great success” and said he had agreed to visit China in April. He added that Xi would visit the US “some time after that”.\\nThe summit may help the two countries’ relationship enter a “more constructive phase” following a series of clashes over trade, according to observers, but they warned that a series of deep-rooted problems within the relationship could still derail any progress.\\nThe 100-minute meeting was the first face-to-face encounter between the two leaders since Trump returned to the White House in January.\\n“Given our different national conditions, we do not always see eye to eye with each other and it is normal for the two leading economies of the world to have frictions now and then,” Xi told the US leader, according to the Chinese foreign ministry.\\nHe added he was willing to continue working with Trump to “build a solid foundation for China-US relations and create a sound atmosphere for the development of both countries”.\\nSpeaking to reporters on Air Force One shortly after he left South Korea, Trump said the two leaders had “agreed to almost everything” and described the summit as “amazing” and a “good meeting for two very large, powerful countries”.\\nAsked when a deal would be ready, he replied: “I think pretty soon. We have not too many major stumbling blocks.”\\nHe had previously threatened additional tariffs over China’s expanded curbs on rare earths, but after the meeting he said: “We have a deal … We’ll negotiate at the end of the year but all of the rare earth [issue] has been settled.\\n“There’s no roadblock at all on rare earth. That will hopefully disappear from our vocabulary for a little while.”\\nFollowing the summit, the Chinese Ministry of Commerce said the country’s latest curbs on rare earth exports – announced earlier this month – would be paused for a year.\\nTrump added that fentanyl – another long-standing source of tension – was a complex issue, but the two leaders “agreed that [China] was going to work very hard” on it and take some “real action”.\\nWashington, he continued, had agreed to halve its fentanyl-related tariffs on China from 20 per cent to 10 per cent. The move also reduces the overall tariff rate on Chinese imports from 57 per cent to 47 per cent.\\nDuring his first term, Trump placed sanctions on China, which he accused of failing to stop the export of the chemicals used to make the synthetic opioids that have been blamed for hundreds of thousands of deaths in the US.\\nTrump said Beijing had also agreed to buy “tremendous amounts of soybeans and other farm products” immediately.\\nAccording to American agricultural lobby groups, China had already made its first soybean purchases from this autumn’s US crop ahead of the meeting.\\nThe US leader added that other topics discussed included chips and ways of working together to end the Ukraine war, but he said Taiwan – one of the most sensitive topics in their relationship – “never came up”. There was no reference to the issue in statements from the Chinese side.\\nBefore the meeting, there had been speculation that Trump would shift Washington’s long-standing position on Taiwan to reach a deal with Beijing.\\nBeijing sees Taiwan as part of China and has never ruled out the use of force to reunify it with the mainland.\\nThe US, in common with most countries, does not recognise Taiwan as an independent state, but Washington is opposed to any attempt to take the island by force and is committed to supplying it with weapons to defend itself.\\n“Overall, I guess on the scale of zero to 10, with 10 being the best, I would say the meeting was a 12 … The whole relationship is very, very important,” Trump said.\\n\\n\\nXi told Trump: “China-US economic and trade relations have experienced ups and downs recently, and this has also given the two sides some insights.\\n“The business relationship should continue to serve as the anchor and driving force for China-US relations, not a stumbling block or a point of friction.”\\nHe added: “The two sides should think big and recognise the long-term benefit of cooperation, and must not fall into a vicious cycle of mutual retaliation.”\\nThe Chinese leader also stressed that dialogue was better than confrontation, adding that communication between the two countries should be maintained “through various channels and at various levels to enhance mutual understanding”.\\nThe report said the two sides had also agreed to cooperate on trade, energy and other areas as well as promote people-to-people exchanges.\\nBeijing also said the two leaders had agreed to maintain regular exchanges but was more vague about the possibility of each visiting the other country.\\nThe foreign ministry’s statement said only that Trump “looked forward to visiting China early next year” and that he had invited Xi to America.\\nDylan Loh, an associate professor at Singapore’s Nanyang Technological University, said the Xi-Trump meeting was consequential because it addressed a number of “irritants” both old and new in US-China relations.\\n“The agreements reached on rare earths, soybeans, fentanyl and the possibility of loosening chips restrictions would create conditions to inject stability into the relationship,” he said.\\nHe also said the “positive comments and conciliatory tone” from both leaders were significant because they signalled to both government officials and their respective publics “that there is scope to bring the relationship back to a more normal track”.\\nLoh added that “US-China competition is not going to stop” because of the summit or Trump’s possible visit to China.\\n“What the meetings do, however, is to help reduce instability and volatility,” he said.\\n\\n\\nAccording to Sun Chenghao, a fellow at Tsinghua University’s Centre for International Security and Strategy, the summit generated positive momentum for future relations and effectively prevented a further escalation of tensions.\\nHe said the two leaders had provided “clear, top-level direction” for the two countries’ trade relations and he expected a “relatively stable frequency of talks” between high-level officials as the two sides focused on implementing the agreements they had reached.\\n“Based on the consensus reached and Trump’s planned visit to China, US-China relations are expected to enter a more constructive phase in the short term,” he said.\\nBut Sun warned that even if the meeting had helped to reopen communications channels between the two sides, deep-seated structural issues – ranging from technology controls to industrial policies and market access – remained unresolved, which meant that a more comprehensive deal would be more difficult to achieve.\\nHe also warned that there were differing voices on China within the Trump administration, and that those who had been calling for a tougher approach towards Beijing could still disrupt the relationship between the two countries.\\nHan Shen Lin, the China managing director for The Asia Group, said sustained de-escalation in the near term was possible, but relations were “fragile” and depended on factors such as China’s fentanyl crackdown or US tariff relief.\\n“Domestic politics could also derail progress if either side seems weak. Notwithstanding the occasional flare-ups, the truce should hold enough for future Trump-Xi talks to continue, which is better than an unchecked trade war,” he said.\\nThe meeting took place in South Korea ahead of this year’s Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (Apec) forum in Gyeongju.\\nTrump arrived in the country on Wednesday, when he met President Lee Jae-myung, but will not stay for the Apec summit and left soon after his talks with Xi finished.\\nXi, who arrived in Busan the following day, is expected to stay in the country for three days. The trip is likely to include a meeting with Lee as well as the Apec event.\\nAdditional reporting by Kandy Wong\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "description": "A Hong Kong student has been sentenced to up to nine months of hard labour for coercing two 12-year-old girls into taking more than 250 nude photographs for him.\\nThe District Court on Thursday sentenced the 20-year-old man, only identified by his initials LYF, to a period of detention at a training centre on two counts of inciting a child under 16 to commit a grossly indecent act.\\nThe crimes came to light when the father of one victim inspected her belongings a week after her suicide on March 15, 2023.\\nHe discovered the accused had repeatedly requested nude photos from his daughter on WhatsApp and Instagram between December 2022 and February 2023.\\nA subsequent police inquiry found the girl, identified as X, had sent 190 obscene photos to the defendant between February 10 and 25, 2023.\\nThe investigation also found that another girl, Y, who was X’s secondary schoolmate, had sent at least 67 photos and six video clips to the accused via WhatsApp, some showing her in sexually provocative postures.\\nUpon his arrest, the student admitted to asking X for her nude photos a month after befriending her on Instagram in late 2022.\\nHe said he would solicit money of up to HK$100 from X when she refused. While insisting he had returned the money, the student said he was unsure if all outstanding sums had been settled.\\nThe student pleaded guilty earlier this month to both counts.\\nA psychologist from the Correctional Services Department reported that the defendant posed a high risk of reoffending, citing his paedophillic tendencies and obsession with online pornography.\\nDeputy Judge Raymond Wong Kwok-fai on Thursday adopted the department’s recommendation, sentencing the student to a detention centre after agreeing that disciplinary training at the correctional facility would benefit the accused.\\nThe student is also required to undergo psychological counselling as directed by the correctional authorities.\\n",

            "description": "Chinese toymaker Pop Mart, maker of the Labubu monster dolls, is expanding into the Middle East with the opening of its first store in the region, marking a significant milestone in its international growth.\\nLaunched in partnership with Qatar Duty Free (QDF), the new store is situated in the North Node area of Hamad International Airport in Doha, Qatar’s capital. It features a selection of travel-themed exclusive collectibles, including card holders, travel pillows and bags.\\nThe outlet, which opened its doors on Tuesday, is the first Pop Mart location to operate 24/7.\\n“This new store is a testament to our commitment to meeting fans wherever they are,” said Justin Moon, senior vice-president and chief operating officer of Pop Mart.\\n“Pop Mart adds a new dimension of creativity and fun to our retail mix,” said Thabet Musleh, chief retail and hospitality officer with QDF owner Qatar Airways Group.\\n\\nFounded by millennial entrepreneur Wang Ning in 2010, Pop Mart began with the concept of selling toys in so-called blind boxes, which conceal their content in opaque wrappings.\\nThe company has since evolved from a seller of plush toys and fridge magnets in Beijing’s Zhongguancun area to become the world’s largest toy company by market value.\\nPop Mart’s Hong Kong-listed shares rose 0.7 per cent to close at HK$229.80 on Thursday, pushing its market capitalisation to HK$308.6 billion (US$39.7 billion). While that has decreased from more than US$400 billion in August, it still exceeded the combined market value of Hasbro, Mattel and Sanrio.\\nPop Mart’s best-known series, Labubu, has captured the hearts of celebrities including Rihanna, Kim Kardashian, David Beckham, Awkwafina and Lisa from the South Korean girl group Blackpink. The exposure has boosted Labubu’s global popularity.\\nPop Mart began international sales around 2018 via online channels. In 2020, it opened its first overseas store in Seoul.\\nRevenue from its overseas operations surged between 365 per cent and 370 per cent year on year in the third quarter, according to the firm’s earnings preview released last week.\\nSales from the Americas grew more than 13-fold from a year ago, while revenue from Europe jumped more than eight-fold. Sales in Asia more than doubled.\\nLabubu is also gaining traction in the Middle East.\\nGoogle Trends data indicated a surge in interest in the United Arab Emirates following the launch of a new Labubu series in April. Among the largest emirates, Dubai, Abu Dhabi and Sharjah exhibited the strongest interest.\\nIn an interview with the People’s Daily in July, founder and chairman Wang said he expected overseas revenue to surpass domestic sales by the end of this year.\\n",

            "description": "Global gold demand hit a record high in the third quarter of 2025, the World Gold Council said in a new report, adding that it remained upbeat about the outlook for the precious metal.\\nThe findings came amid a recent pullback in gold prices after a months-long rally that had sent it to record highs.\\nGold demand reached 1,313 tonnes – or about US$146 billion in value terms – between July and September, the highest quarterly total on record, according to the report released by the trade association on Thursday.\\nThe report attributed the rise primarily to surging investment demand driven by “a powerful combination of an uncertain and volatile geopolitical environment, US dollar weakness and investor FOMO [fear of missing out] as the price climbed higher”.\\nThat led total gold demand to soar 44 per cent in value terms from the same period last year in the third quarter, while demand rose by a modest 3 per cent year on year in volume terms, the report said.\\n“With the record high level of gold demand and prices in the third quarter of 2025, we expect gold demand to remain strong,” said Fan Shaokai, head of Asia-Pacific (ex-China) and global head of central banks at the World Gold Council, in a press release issued on Thursday.\\nFan added that the association expected central banks to “continue their buying streak” and that the metal would retain “its lustre as a resilient option for a growing pool of investors looking to diversify”.\\n\\n\\nAccording to the report, investment demand grew by 47 per cent year on year in the third quarter, reaching 537 tonnes and accounting for 55 per cent of overall net gold demand.\\nNet purchases by central banks in the third quarter reached 220 tonnes – up 28 per cent from the previous quarter and 10 per cent year on year – despite record-high prices, the report noted.\\nGold prices underwent a decisive pullback last week after the spot price peaked at more than US$4,380 per ounce – a gain of over 60 per cent since the end of last year. The spot price was up 1.9 per cent for the day at just under US$4,004 as of Thursday afternoon, according to financial data provider Wind.\\nThe World Gold Council stressed that the environment remained favourable for gold to continue attracting buyers.\\n“Continued US dollar weakness, lower interest rate expectations and the threat of stagflation could further propel investment demand,” said Louise Street, a senior markets analyst at the association.\\n“Our research indicates the market is not yet saturated and the strategic case to hold gold remains firmly in place.”\\n",
