            "description": "China’s Gelao ethnic group practises an ancient ritual known as “Feeding the Tree”, a bizarre yet unique tradition believed to ensure bountiful harvests.\\nThe Gelao people are an ethnic group in China and Vietnam, with an estimated population of more than 677,000 in China as of 2021.\\nThey live in the Gelao autonomous counties in the Western part of Guizhou, southwestern China.\\nTraditionally, they rely on agriculture, growing rice in flatter terrains and cultivating various grains in the mountainous drylands.\\n\\nThe “Feeding the Tree” or Wei Shu ritual in Chinese is traditionally practised during two major annual events, the Spring Festival and the Gelao New Year, which falls on the third day of the third lunar month.\\nIt is rooted in the Gelao people’s long-standing belief that all things possess spirits and their particular reverence for ancient trees.\\nThe tradition follows a precise ritual designed to ensure fertility and safeguard the year’s harvest.\\nFirst, relatives and friends gather and bring offerings such as rice wine, pork, fresh fish and glutinous rice to a designated site on the mountain.\\nRed paper and firecrackers are also essential parts of the ceremony.\\n\\nUpon reaching the mountain, participants begin by setting off firecrackers.\\nThey then select a tall, thick ancient tree and begin the worship by burning paper and incense, followed by kneeling and bowing.\\nNext comes the feeding ritual.\\nA knife or axe is used to make three small incisions in the bark of the chosen tree.\\nAnother participant then “feeds” the tree by placing symbolic offerings of meat, rice and wine into the cuts. These incisions are then sealed with red paper.\\nTo complete the ritual, participants clear weeds and till the soil around the base of the tree, symbolising cultivation and prosperity.\\nWhen the tree being worshipped is of the fruit variety, the ritual includes a specific and auspicious verbal exchange during the feeding process.\\nThis goes: “Feed you rice, bear clusters; feed you meat, give lumps.”\\n\\nThis precise phrase serves as a symbolic “contract”, expressing a wish for an abundant fruit harvest.\\nIn some Gelao regions, the tradition is also called the “Sacrificing to the Mountain” ritual, typically performed near a tall, lush ancient tree close to the village.\\nThis practice reflects deep reverence for the mountain, which is seen as a powerful source of life and vitality.\\nOnly adult men are allowed to take part.\\nA shaman leads the ceremony by chanting the Mountain Sacrifice Song, praying for peace and a flourishing population.\\n",

            "description": "Halloween is here, spooky vibes are afoot, and every other person you see is dressed as a character from KPop Demon Hunters. The Netflix animated movie became a mega-hit this summer, and the craze shows little sign of abating. The film’s soundtrack, which includes original songs from the fictional K-pop bands Huntr/x and Saja Boys, has gone viral too. The demon-hunting girl group’s single “Golden”, and the demonic boy band’s soul-snatching track “Your Idol” topped the US Spotify chart in July, beating out K-pop powerhouses BTS and Blackpink. “Golden” also topped the US Billboard Hot 100, Billboard Global 200 and Billboard Global Excl. US charts.\\n\\n\\nThanks to such record-breaking success, the vocalists behind Huntr/x and Saja Boys have blown up. Ejae, Audrey Nuna and Rei Ami, the singing voices of Rumi, Mira and Zoey respectively, recently made a cameo on Saturday Night Live and were presenters at this year’s MTV Video Music Awards. Meanwhile, the crooners behind the Saja Boys – Andrew Choi (Jinu Saja), Samuil Lee (Romance Saja), Kevin Woo (Mystery Saja), Neckwav (Abby Saja) and Danny Chung (Baby Saja) – are all over social media. Woo, the only bona fide K-pop idol of the bunch, recently released a viral cover of Saja Boys’ “Soda Pop” and signed with United Talent Agency.\\n\\n\\nSo what else do we know about Kevin Woo? Read on to find out more.\\nKevin Woo comes from a family of creatives\\n\\nKevin Woo, 33, hails from Danville, California, where he grew up in a family of creatives.

            "description": "Starring Jennifer Aniston and Reese Witherspoon, Emmy winner The Morning Show – centred around an eponymous fictional news programme – is currently on its fourth season and is the most popular show on Apple TV at the time of writing.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nView this post on Instagram\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nA post shared by The Morning Show (@themorningshow)\\n\\n\\n\\nOne of the most talked-about plot points this season has been the potential revival of a fan-favourite romance with the return of Claire Conway (Bel Powley). The character walks back into the life of her ex, TMS anchor Yanko Flores, played by Néstor Carbonell, derailing his plan to propose to his girlfriend Ariana (Ashley Reyes). In the latest episode, Person of Interest, Claire is on the run from the FBI and seeks refuge with Flores. Viewers were torn between wanting the pair to reunite and hoping he’d stay loyal to his current partner. In a shocking twist, Yanko gets down on one knee for Ariana. Explaining the character’s decision, Carbonell told Decider, “Season one Yanko would have gone away with [Claire]. Season four Yanko is a bit more settled. He’s a different guy.”\\nCarbonell has been quite the scene-stealer this season. So what else do we know about him? Read on to find out.\\nNéstor Carbonell’s background\\n\\nNéstor Gastón Carbonell was born in New York and raised Catholic by Cuban parents, Rosa Ramírez de Arellano Cárdenas and Néstor Tulio Carbonell Cortina, per Hola! and IMDB. A true third-culture kid, his growing-up years were split across Mexico, Venezuela, the US, the Bahamas and the UK. He graduated from Harvard University with a degree in English. His father was a lawyer; his sister, Rosa Maria “Mia” Carbonell, has worked at Telemundo and Fox.\\nWhere else have you seen him?\\n\\nCarbonell’s acting journey began in off-Broadway theatre, per his IMDB bio. He got his start in Spanish-language commercials and was once hired to play Batman at a children’s party but, he told Hola!, was “terrible”. His big break came when he was cast as Luis Rivera in the late-90s sitcom Suddenly Susan. From 2006 to 2010, he played the enigmatic Richard Alpert in ABC’s Lost. In 2008 and 2012, Carbonell redeemed himself on the Batman front, playing the mayor of Gotham in The Dark Knight and The Dark Knight Rises. He won the 2024 Emmy for outstanding guest actor in a drama series for his role in the FX series Shōgun.\\nIs Néstor Carbonell single?\\n\\nUnfortunately for anyone crushing on Carbonell, the 57-year-old is married. He met his wife, Australian actress Shannon Kenny, in 1994, per Hola! The pair worked together on the 1995 TV show Muscle and were married in 2001. They welcomed sons Rafael and Marco in 2002 and 2005, after which Kenny retired from acting. “I am in awe of her, of what she has accomplished professionally as an actress and of what she has done as a mother,” Carbonell gushed to Hola! Their sons are pursuing music.\\n",

            "description": "The National Games in Hong Kong got off to a quiet start on Friday, with only a few hundred fans watching the first day of beach volleyball, but also with hopes voiced that younger attendees would be inspired.\\nSchoolchildren dominated the crowd as the action unfolded during working hours from 9am at a purpose-built venue in Victoria Park, in a competition that will run until November 10. Beach volleyball is one of eight sports Hong Kong will host at the Games.\\nBoth the city’s women’s teams were defeated by their mainland counterparts. Hong Kong’s top pairing, twin sisters To Wing-man and To Wing-tung, were on court at 12pm and lost 2-0 to Chongqing.\\nThe city’s second women’s duo, Au Yeung Wai Yan and Yeung Ting-chi, then followed and were beaten 2-0 by Jiangsu.\\nAnson Lau, 30, a PE and maths teacher, had brought Hong Kong Southern District Government Primary School’s young volleyball team to watch the matches, in the hope that the experience would further develop their love for the sport.\\n\\n“We got free tickets from the Education Bureau,” she said. “I’ll teach the students about the game, tell them the names of the moves and the rules, and allow them to feel the vibe.\\n“I hope they can learn to love the game.”\\nLau said she would also take students to watch the cycling and rugby sevens events.\\n“I also play volleyball, so I actually enjoy coming here to watch. The Hong Kong team [twin sisters To] are getting a lot better; their quality is much closer to the international level.”\\nPeggy Li, who is in her forties and works in sales, has played volleyball since she was a child and came to show her support for Hong Kong’s women’s teams and study the mainland teams.\\n“The level of competition is very high, especially the Shanghai and Shandong teams,” she said.\\n“Actually, I really like the Hong Kong team, and I will go to Macau for the [indoor] volleyball.”\\nDespite the low number of spectators, those in attendance did crank up the volume when Hong Kong’s players took to the court. Organisers had also taken audio from the FIVB Men’s &amp; Women’s Volleyball Nations League so that fans could chant “monster block” or “super-spike” after plays.\\n\\n“The atmosphere is quite unique,” To Wing-tung said. “The sensation you feel that moment when you step onto the pitch and many people recognise you, call out your name, it can be a bit nerve-racking.\\n“We desperately wanted to put on a good performance for everyone watching, so during the warm-up, we felt some pressure.\\n“But once we stepped onto the court, we realised we were actually enjoying the match. From the very first point, we suddenly found ourselves connecting with so many shots – something we might not manage consistently in training.\\n“We were suddenly very proactive, eager and fully immersed in the game.”\\n",

            "description": "US Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth met Chinese Defence Minister Dong Jun in person for the first time on Friday, with both sides saying they are pushing for peace a day after a summit between their presidents brought tensions down.\\nThe discussion on the sidelines of the Asean Defence Ministers’ Meeting Plus in Malaysia was the first face-to-face meeting between the defence ministers of China and the US since Donald Trump’s return to the White House, although Dong and Hegseth had held a video call in September.\\nHegseth described his talks with Dong in Kuala Lumpur as “a good and constructive meeting” in a post on X on Friday.\\n\\n\\nHe said the US did not seek conflict, echoing statements he made during a video call with Dong in September.\\nDong said China was committed to peaceful development while resolutely safeguarding its national security interests, and had the full capability to calmly respond to any infringements or provocations, according to a statement from China’s defence ministry.\\n“We hope the US will implement its statements of not containing China and not seeking conflict with concrete actions,” Dong said.\\nHe said Chinese President Xi Jinping and his counterpart Trump’s successful meeting in South Korea provided strategic guidance for the stable development of China-US relations in their next stage, adding that the defence departments of both countries should take concrete actions to implement the consensus reached by the heads of state.\\nThe Xi-Trump meeting on Thursday was the first between them since Trump began his second term in January. Both sides appeared to show personal warmth and downplay the competitive aspect of the meeting while stating they had achieved some trade negotiation results and expressing an intention to visit each others’ countries.\\n“The two countries should strengthen decision-making level communication to increase trust and eliminate suspicion … and encourage universities, academia and the strategic community to provide support for the two militaries to explore the correct way of coexisting,” Dong said.\\nAnd Hegseth wrote on X: “We will continue discussions with the People’s Liberation Army on matters of mutual importance”.\\nThe issue of Taiwan, which has been included in almost all in-person meetings between Xi Jinping and his US counterparts in recent years, was surprisingly absent from public statements from Beijing and Washington about Thursday’s meeting.\\nHowever, the two defence chiefs brought up the issue on Friday. Dong said the US should be cautious in its words and actions on the Taiwan issue and must unequivocally oppose “Taiwan independence”.\\n“The reunification of the two sides of the Taiwan Strait is an unstoppable historical trend,” Dong added.\\nHegseth reiterated US concerns about China’s activities in the South China Sea and the Taiwan Strait and posted on X that he had met Philippine Defence Secretary Gilberto Teodoro Jnr on Friday.\\n“We will work relentlessly to reestablish deterrence in the South China Sea and advance our alliance,” he posted.\\nThe defence ministers’ statements appeared mild compared to talks between the nations’ defence ministers in May last year.\\nAt that time, Dong warned then US defence secretary Lloyd Austin about the US congratulating William Lai Ching-te on being elected Taiwan’s leader, saying it sent “a seriously wrong signal to the pro-independence separatist forces”.\\n\\n\\nAustin expressed concern at the time about the PLA’s activities in the Taiwan Strait, emphasising that China should not use Taiwan’s political transition as a pretext for coercive measures.\\nBeijing sees Taiwan as part of China to be reunited by force if necessary. Most countries, including the US, do not recognise Taiwan as an independent state, but Washington is opposed to any attempt to take the self-governed island by force and is committed to supplying it with weapons.\\nFriday’s meeting also came amid reports of an ongoing change to the US’ overall defence strategy. Reports suggest that the Pentagon’s new national defence strategy, which is still being developed, may prioritise the protection of the homeland and the western hemisphere, marking a departure from making competition with China and Russia a top priority.\\n",

            "description": "A former Philippine lawmaker accused of masterminding a vast public works corruption scheme allegedly tried to move part of his fortune out of reach of investigators by flying his private aircraft abroad.\\nA Gulfstream jet and two helicopters linked to disgraced congressman Elizaldy “Zaldy” Co were sent to Singapore and Malaysia in recent months, just as authorities were preparing to freeze billions of pesos in suspected ill-gotten assets.\\nPhilippine aviation regulators say the aircraft cannot now be sold or re-registered overseas under international aviation law, even though they left the country before formal proceedings began.\\nThe discovery is the latest twist in an escalating corruption scandal that has gripped the Philippines, where Co – until recently the powerful head of the House appropriations committee – is accused of orchestrating fraudulent public works projects worth billions of pesos.\\nThe Civil Aviation Authority of the Philippines (CAAP) confirmed in a statement issued on Thursday “that three registered air assets connected to Mr. Co have departed from the country”.\\n“We are coordinating with the civil aviation authorities of the countries that these aircraft flew to and we are asking them to help monitor because that is all we can do for now,” CAAP Director General Raul del Rosario said at a press conference as quoted by GMA News.\\n\\nThe three aircraft are part of a fleet that includes at least 13 helicopters and fixed-wing planes registered to companies linked to Co. The fleet’s scale has drawn widespread outrage, particularly after comparisons showed Co’s private air assets outnumbered those of the Philippine Coast Guard.\\n“It is disheartening to see a legislator possessing numerous air assets,” coastguard spokesman Jay Tarriela said in late September, noting that the entire coastguard had just three planes and two helicopters.\\nPublic Works Secretary Vince Dizon said the fleet included a Gulfstream G350 executive jet valued at more than US$26 million, which was located in Singapore as early as August 16.\\nTwo AgustaWestland helicopters were flown to Kota Kinabalu, Malaysia, on August 20 and September 11. Co himself was not on board any of the flights, according to regulators.\\nThe remaining 10 aircraft are still in the Philippines and are under active monitoring by CAAP.\\nDespite some having left the country before Co’s assets were frozen, CAAP officials stressed that none of the aircraft can legally be sold or re-registered abroad. Under international aviation law, aircraft cannot be registered in a new jurisdiction unless they are first deregistered by the original country.\\nThe CAAP has issued a hold on the deregistration of all 13 aircraft, effectively freezing their resale value.\\n“You cannot sell it or transfer ownership unless it is deregistered in the Philippines,” Dizon said at a press briefing on September 30, as quoted by ABS-CBN.\\nAttempts by Co’s companies to deregister some of the aircraft in September were blocked by CAAP in coordination with the Anti-Money Laundering Council (AMLC) and the National Bureau of Investigation.\\n\\n\\nThe freeze on Co’s aviation assets is part of a broader multi-agency investigation into alleged systemic corruption in the Philippines’ flood-control infrastructure programme.\\nAs appropriations chair, Co allegedly inserted hundreds of billions of pesos into the public works budget for so-called flood-control projects. Investigators say many of these were substandard or fictitious, with funds funnelled to contractors who delivered kickbacks in cash-stuffed suitcases.\\nOn October 23, AMLC disclosed that it had frozen 5.2 billion pesos (US$89 million) in assets linked to Co and his associates. “We’re still waiting for the submission of other bank accounts and valuation of other properties,” AMLC Executive Director Matthew David said, as quoted by GMA News.\\nCo resigned from Congress on September 29, citing “grave and imminent threats” to his safety. In a statement reported by GMA News, he said: “All I can tell you now is that the accusations being made against me are false … I can only stay silent to protect my family and myself.”\\nHe had left the country in July for medical reasons, and his current whereabouts are unknown. The justice department has requested an Interpol “blue notice” to locate him.\\nThe wider corruption scandal – widely dubbed the “ghost flood-control” controversy – centres on hundreds of budget insertions allegedly made by lawmakers to fund infrastructure projects that were either non-existent or awarded to politically connected contractors.\\nMany of these projects were approved without proper documentation or on-site verification, allowing what investigators believe was a coordinated kickback scheme to flourish across multiple provinces.\\nPublic anger has intensified in recent weeks, fuelled by viral videos showing contractors and officials flaunting luxury cars, designer goods and overseas travel. In response, President Ferdinand Marcos Jnr has formed an independent commission to investigate what is likely to be one of the Philippines’ most consequential corruption cases in decades.\\n",

            "title": "A Great Wall, the first American film shot in China, told a genial East meets West tale",
            "description": "This is the latest instalment in a feature series reflecting on instances of East meets West in world cinema, including China-US co-productions.\\nIf asked to name the first American film to be shot and co-produced in China, most film buffs would likely say Bernardo Bertolucci’s 1987 Oscar winner The Last Emperor – and they would be wrong.\\nThe correct answer is Peter Wang Zhengfang’s modest 1986 comedy-drama A Great Wall, which was filmed in both countries and has since slipped from the public consciousness. This is a pity because, as a snapshot of two opposing cultures attempting to get along, it makes for rewarding viewing.\\nBorn in Beijing, Wang left for Taiwan in 1949, emigrating to the United States in the 1970s to pursue a PhD in electro-optics.\\n\\n\\nInstead, he went into film, acting in the 1982 indie Chan Is Missing, a key work of Asian-American cinema, and the 1983 film Ah Ying, a neo-realistic classic in the Hong Kong New Wave movement.\\nIn that same year, Wang also partnered with producer/co-writer Shirley Sun and the Chinese production company Nanhai to make his debut as a writer, director and star. The resulting work, A Great Wall, proved a genial tale of the misunderstandings that emerge when East meets West.\\nIn the film, middle-aged Chinese-American émigré Leo Fang (Wang) works for a computing company in San Francisco. When he is passed over for a promotion, he quits his job and takes his wife, Grace (Sharon Iwai), and son, Paul (Kelvin Han Yee), on holiday to Beijing, his hometown, for the summer.\\nUpon arrival, they stay with Leo’s sister, Mrs Chao (Shen Guanglan), her traditionalist husband (Hu Xiaoguang) and their teenage daughter, Lili (Li Qinqin).\\n\\nAs the families get to know each other, Paul finds himself competing for Lili’s affections with local boy Yida (Wang Xiao), soon to become his rival at the local table tennis club.\\nAt one point, we watch the teenagers playing American football on the Great Wall, but the title actually refers to the city’s Ming dynasty fortifications, which, Leo notes, were intended to keep the inhabitants in as much as invaders out.\\nAs a first-time writer-director, Wang drew heavily on his own background.\\n“This is not by choice,” he told journalist Randy Parker. “If I want to make independent films and write my own scripts, I have to base [them] on the experiences that I am familiar with. And I happen to be Chinese-American.”\\nAlthough there is a big disconnect between the Fangs and the Chaos, it is mostly explored with wry amusement. We see Leo limbering up for a jog, while Mr Chao practises tai chi. Grace and Mrs Chao swap fashion and make-up tips, and Paul queues to get on a packed bus, which drives off without him.\\n\\nMostly, we are left with the sense of two families – and two cultures – trying each other on for size. The best moments are the sweetest ones, such as Yida and his friend Yu (Xiu Jian) strutting about pretending to be American models.\\nBut there are occasional hints of darkness. Mrs Chao reads Lili’s letters – in China, we are told, there is no such thing as privacy – and Yida and Yu cannot afford to drink Coca-Cola because it costs half a day’s wages.\\nBoth Paul and Mr Chao have revealing – if offensive – outbursts. “The American society is corrupt,” says the usually jolly Mr Chao. “It’s full of crime and also sexually promiscuous. And the streets are full of homosexuals.”\\nPerhaps Paul hews closer to the film’s viewpoint when he tells Leo, “All Chinese parents are racists. You use the tradition and the culture to cover the racism.”\\n\\n\\nUltimately, though, this is a film about what connects people, rather than what divides them. After a low-stakes table tennis match, the Paul-Lili-Yida love triangle is resolved. Back home in America, Grace wears a Chinese garment made for her by Mrs Chao, while Leo practises tai chi.\\nIn China, meanwhile, Lili learns to stick up for herself, telling her mother, “Privacy is privacy, you can’t translate it!” and Yida earns a celebratory bottle of cola for passing his exams.\\nWang, it seems, was aiming for the subtle generational dramas of Yasujiro Ozu’s 1953 classic Tokyo Story – hence the Chinese title, which translates as Beijing Story. But the film’s spirit of gentle revolution might have stopped it from being widely shown in China.\\nIt was more warmly received in America, with critic Roger Ebert writing, “A Great Wall is about the sort of visit I imagine most of us would like to make, back to the people and the ways of life where we, or our ancestors, came from. We would likely discover what the Fangs discover, that you can’t go home again.”\\nThe same was true for Wang. After two more modest co-productions, he disappeared into obscurity.\\nWant more articles like this? Follow SCMP Film on Facebook\\n",

            "description": "Apple is struggling in China as sales decline amid cutthroat competition with domestic brands, but CEO Tim Cook says he is confident of a rebound on the back of rising demand for the iPhone 17 line-up.\\nThe US tech giant’s revenue in Greater China, which covers mainland China, Hong Kong and Taiwan, dropped 4 per cent year on year to US$14.5 billion in the three months ended September, the company reported on Thursday.\\nOn a conference call with analysts, Cook attributed China’s sales weakness to “supply constraints” during the quarter that affected the availability of some iPhone 16 and 17 models, despite strong demand.\\nHe expressed optimism that the China market would return to growth, citing the positive reception of the iPhone 17 series.\\n\\n“With [store] traffic being up significantly year on year and [because of] the reception of the [iPhone] 17 family, we expect to return to growth this quarter,” Cook said.\\nReleased in September, the iPhone 17 series drove up Apple’s smartphone sales by 29 per cent in the first two weeks of October, topping China’s sales chart, according to data released by Counterpoint Research on Friday.\\nThe total iPhone sales between September 29 and October 12 in China jumped 40 per cent year on year, driven by the value of the product, the demand for a smartphone upgrade, and the holiday shopping season, the Counterpoint report showed.\\nThe US company is locked in an intense competition with domestic brands in China, the world’s largest smartphone market.\\nBeijing-based Xiaomi, which made a bold move to challenge Apple with its Xiaomi 17 series, recorded a 21 per cent increase in the first two weeks of October, Counterpoint data showed.\\nFollowing Apple’s new iPhone releases, Xiaomi skipped directly to the Xiaomi 17 series after last year’s Xiaomi 15 line-up. Xiaomi founder and CEO Lei Jun said the new devices were “fully benchmarked against the iPhone and ready for head-to-head competition”.\\nIn addition to market competition, Apple is also under pressure to roll out its long-awaited artificial intelligence features in China. During a six-day visit in China earlier this month, Cook said that AI was “making a difference in people’s lives” and that the company was “working on getting [Apple Intelligence] into China right now”. He did not, however, provide a timeline.\\nApple Intelligence – a built-in AI feature of the company’s iOS 18, iPadOS 18 and macOS Sequoia operating systems – was announced in June last year. Chinese regulatory restrictions have made this feature unavailable in Apple devices used in mainland China and Hong Kong.\\n",

            "description": "Indian customs officers have arrested a plane passenger after discovering two endangered gibbons stuffed inside a checked bag, the latest animals seized from smugglers at Mumbai’s airport.\\nOne of the tiny apes from Indonesia was dead, while the other, in a video shared by Indian Customs, was seen cradled in the arms of an officer, softly hooting before covering its face with its arm.\\nCustoms said the passenger, who had travelled from Malaysia via Thailand, was given the rare apes by a wildlife trafficking “syndicate” for delivery in India.\\nOfficers acting on “specific intelligence” arrested the passenger in Mumbai on Thursday.\\n“A subsequent search of their checked baggage, a trolley bag, led to the discovery and seizure of two silvery gibbons (Hylobates moloch), one live and one found dead, which were concealed in a basket,” the customs department said.\\n\\nWildlife trade monitor Traffic, which battles the smuggling of wild animals and plants, warned in June of a “very troubling” trend in trafficking driven by the exotic pet trade.\\nMore than 7,000 animals, dead and alive, have been seized along the Thailand-India air route in the last 3½ years, it said.\\nThe small silvery gibbon calls the rainforests of Java in Indonesia home. They are threatened by the loss of forests, hunting and the pet trade, according to the International Union for Conservation of Nature.\\nEstimates for the primates left range from about 2,500 to 4,000.\\nThe seizure follows several recent smuggling busts at the same airport.\\nJust a week earlier, customs officials said they had arrested another smuggler carrying snakes, tortoises and a raccoon.\\nIn June, Mumbai customs intercepted two passengers arriving from Thailand with dozens of venomous vipers and more than 100 other creatures, including lizards, sunbirds and tree-climbing possums, also arriving from Thailand.\\nIn February, customs officials at Mumbai airport stopped a smuggler with five siamang gibbons, an ape native to the forests of Indonesia, Malaysia and Thailand.\\n",
