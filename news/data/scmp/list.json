            "description": "A tropical depression has formed east of the Philippines and is expected to drift northwest, but it will not enter within 800km (497 miles) of the city, according to the forecaster.\\nThe Hong Kong Observatory said it could strengthen into a severe tropical storm as early as Monday, with maximum sustained winds near the centre reaching around 110km/h (68mph).\\nAs of 8pm on Saturday, the tropical depression over the western North Pacific was centred about 140km northwest of Yap. It is forecast to move west-northwest at about 18km/h towards the seas east of the Philippines.\\nThe Observatory’s forecast for the storm currently extends up to Thursday, when it will be located to the west of Hong Kong and remain outside the 800km range of the city.\\nThe Observatory said the cyclone is expected to continue intensifying, with an increasing chance of crossing the Philippines and entering the central and southern parts of the South China Sea around midweek, moving towards the vicinity of Vietnam.\\n“An area of low pressure is bringing unsettled weather to the central and southern parts of the South China Sea,” the forecaster said, adding that the weather would be mainly cloudy with light rain patches on Saturday night or Sunday morning.\\nNext week would begin windy and cloudy, and the weather would turn cooler on Wednesday morning with sunny periods during the day, the Observatory added.\\nThe highest temperatures from Saturday to next Saturday will range between 25 and 27 degrees Celsius (77 and 81 Fahrenheit), with only a low chance of rainfall.\\n",

            "description": "Israel said on Saturday that three bodies it received from Gaza the night before were not hostages held in the Palestinian territory, as a Hamas security source reported fresh strikes in the south.\\nDespite occasional flare-ups, a fragile truce has been holding in Gaza since October 10, based on a US-brokered deal centred on the return of all Israeli hostages, both living and dead.\\nIsrael’s military said that a forensic analysis revealed that three bodies it received via the Red Cross on Friday were not those of the deceased captives still to be handed over as part of the ceasefire deal.\\nA second Israeli military official confirmed on Saturday that they were not aware of any hostages, followed by the office of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.\\n“The remains we received are not our hostages,” the office said.\\nIt was unclear who they might be and why they were returned to Israel. The two Israeli officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorised to talk to the media.\\nHamas’s armed wing said on Saturday that it had handed over bodies it had not positively identified, alleging Israel had declined its offer to provide samples for testing and “demanded the bodies for examination”.\\n“We handed them over to pre-empt any enemy claims,” the Ezzedine Al-Qassam Brigades said.\\nAfter the start of the truce, Hamas returned the 20 surviving hostages still in its custody and began the process of returning the remains of the dead.\\nOf the 17 bodies returned since the start of the ceasefire, 15 were Israelis, one was Thai and one was Nepalese.\\nHamas has also returned another unidentified body that had not been listed among the 28 missing, as well as the partial remains of a deceased Israeli hostage who had already been recovered early in the war.\\nThat incident drew outrage in Israel, which said the group had violated the agreement by returning the partial remains rather than the body of another hostage.\\nIsrael has accused Hamas of not returning the dead hostages quickly enough, but the Palestinian group says it will take time to locate remains buried in Gaza’s ruins.\\nIn its statement Saturday, the Al-Qassam Brigades called on mediators and the Red Cross to provide the “necessary equipment and personnel to work on recovering all the bodies simultaneously”.\\nThe remains of the three people handed over by Hamas followed Israel’s return on Friday of the bodies of 30 Palestinians to Gaza.\\nThe total number of Palestinian bodies returned by Israel since the ceasefire began now stands at 225. Only 75 of those have been identified by families, according to Gaza’s Health Ministry.\\nIt is unclear if those returned were killed in Israel during the October 7, 2023 attack, whether they died in Israeli custody as detainees or were recovered from Gaza by troops during the war.\\n\\nWarships opened fire\\nHamas and Israel, meanwhile, have traded accusations of breaking the ceasefire.\\nA Hamas security source said on Saturday that Israel had carried out several air strikes in the south at dawn, and that “warships opened fire toward the shores of Khan Younis”.\\nEarlier in the week, the Israeli military launched its deadliest night of bombing since the truce after one of its soldiers was killed in south Gaza, with the territory’s civil defence agency reporting more than 100 people killed.\\nHamas denied it had anything to do with the attack, and Israel later said it had begun “renewed enforcement of the ceasefire”.\\nFather-of-five Hisham al-Bardai, who recently returned to his home in north Gaza’s Jabalia camp, said on Saturday that he had heard “gunfire several times from the occupation forces” during the night.\\n“The truce has begun, but the war hasn’t ended, and [Israel’s] policy of starvation continues,” he said, referring to Israel’s strict blockade on the entry of supplies into Gaza, which it eased after the ceasefire went into effect.\\nLike many Gazans who moved back to neighbourhoods previously under evacuation orders, Bardai found a collapsed building where his home once stood.\\n“Despite the widespread destruction in Jabalia camp, people are starting to return, even though the situation is dangerous,” the 37-year-old said.\\n\\n‘No hope for life’\\nThe implementation of the later stages of US President Donald Trump’s ceasefire plan has yet to be agreed, particularly as it concerns disarming Hamas, establishing a transitional authority and deploying an international stabilisation force.\\nThe force is expected to be drawn from a coalition of mainly Arab and Muslim nations, and would train and support vetted Palestinian police, with backing from Egypt and Jordan, as well as secure border areas and prevent weapons smuggling.\\nThe foreign ministers of Jordan and Germany insisted on Saturday at a conference in Bahrain that the international force have the blessing of the United Nations.\\n“We all agree that in order for that stabilisation force to be able to be effective in getting the job done, it has to have a Security Council mandate,” Jordanian Foreign Minister Ayman Safadi said.\\nHis German counterpart Johann Wadephul said such a mandate would be of the “utmost importance to those countries who might be willing to send troops to Gaza, and for the Palestinians”.\\nMany Gazans remain displaced and living in tents or makeshift shelters.\\nSumaya Daloul, a 27-year-old living in a tent with her parents and siblings in Gaza City, said she did not have much hope for the future.\\n“I expect the suffering in Gaza to continue for years. There’s no hope for life to return, even partially,” she said.\\n",

            "title": "Why China chose tech-hub Shenzhen to host the 2026 Apec summit",
            "description": "China’s decision to host next year’s Apec summit in the innovation hub of Shenzhen reflects Beijing’s “resolve to uphold openness”, according to analysts.\\nHighlighting the southern city’s spectacular growth over the past few decades, Chinese President Xi Jinping announced the decision at the end of the 2025 Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (Apec) summit in Gyeongju, South Korea, on Saturday.\\n“Located on the Pacific coast and adjacent to Hong Kong, Shenzhen has transformed from a backward fishing village into a modern international metropolis in just a few decades,” Xi said.\\n“Together with surrounding areas, it forms the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macau Greater Bay Area, which can be considered a growth pole of the world economy.”\\n\\n\\nAnalysts said China’s choice of Shenzhen as the host city reflected various considerations, including the desire to highlight the country’s gains in economic development.\\nZhu Feng, executive dean of Nanjing University’s school of international studies, described Shenzhen as “a landmark city symbolising China’s economic integration with the world”.\\nSelecting Shenzhen would demonstrate to the world “the alignment and integration of China’s economic development with the global economy following reform and opening up”, Zhu said.\\nThe message could be amplified if US President Donald Trump decides to attend the gathering.\\nDuring talks before the Apec summit on Thursday, Xi and Trump extended invitations for reciprocal state visits.\\nState news agency Xinhua also quoted Trump as saying that the United States would be happy to see the success of both next year’s Apec meeting in China and the G20 summit in Miami.\\nZhu said that if there was frequent high-level dialogue between the two countries next year, “the likelihood of Trump attending a summit in Shenzhen is considerable”.\\nIn that case, the Shenzhen summit would serve as “a significant diplomatic opportunity to further strengthen the strategic relationship between the two nations’ leaders”, he said.\\nZhu added that a summit in Shenzhen could also provide “a crucial diplomatic occasion for further integration into the global and Western spheres” for US-sanctioned enterprises, including telecommunications giant Huawei Technologies, which is headquartered in the city.\\nThis would also enable China to “further reduce the excessive focus on security in US-China relations”, according to Zhu.\\n\\n\\nShenzhen has grown exponentially from its fishing village roots more than four decades ago to become a city of nearly 18 million people.\\nIt is also one of China’s leading centres for hi-tech innovation, including artificial intelligence and other areas of strict competition with the US.\\nBut while it is China’s “most successful special economic zone”, it simultaneously “endures the most severe blows from trade protectionism and technological decoupling”, according to Peng Peng, executive chairman of the Guangdong Society of Reform, a think tank affiliated with the Guangdong provincial government.\\nAccording to Peng, selecting Shenzhen as the Apec host city demonstrated China’s “resolve to uphold openness and continue guiding the direction of globalisation”.\\nFurthermore, a summit in Shenzhen would enable “the world, particularly major nations, to gain a comprehensive and in-depth understanding of the Greater Bay Area’s development progress and overall strength”.\\nShenzhen is one of nine cities in Guangdong that make up the Greater Bay Area, which also includes the special administrative regions of Hong Kong and Macau.\\nIn recent years, Beijing has sought to transform the Greater Bay Area into a world-class economic and innovation hub.\\nHong Kong Chief Executive John Lee Ka-chiu said the announcement about Shenzhen made him feel “motivated”, and the city would do its best to support the Apec meeting next year.\\n“We are thrilled … Shenzhen is our close neighbour. Our relationship is very close,” he said.\\n“The Hong Kong government is fully prepared and will be very excited to be able to support the organisation and success of the Apec conference.”\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPeng said Hong Kong could be the first stop for some Apec leaders on their way to the summit, given that Hong Kong operated more international flight routes than Shenzhen.\\nHe said the provincial capital Guangzhou, which hosts a number of consulates, could also feature on leaders’ itineraries.\\nThe overall effects would be “positive and beneficial” but it was difficult now to “comprehensively assess the spillover effects” of the Apec summit on other cities in the Greater Bay Area, including Hong Kong, he said.\\nIn recent years, China has selected lesser-known cities to host multilateral diplomatic events, aiming to boost their international profile.\\nFor example, the northern port city of Tianjin hosted the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation summit earlier this year while the coastal city of Qingdao was the backdrop for the bloc’s gathering in 2018.\\nOther cases include the 2016 G20 summit in the eastern city of Hangzhou, the 2017 Brics summit in the southeastern coastal city of Xiamen, and the 2023 China-Central Asia Summit in western city of Xian.\\nShenzhen will be the third Chinese city to host the Apec meeting – Shanghai hosted in 2001 and Beijing in 2014.\\nOn Friday, Xi called on world leaders to uphold multilateralism and ensure supply chain stability.\\nIn a separate address on Saturday, the Chinese leader warned of intensifying challenges such as climate change and energy security, calling on regional economies to deepen cooperation and “seize new opportunities”.\\nXi said countries should promote the “sound and orderly development of artificial intelligence while ensuring that it is beneficial, safe and fair”.\\nXi arrived in South Korea on Thursday and held talks with various world leaders on the sidelines of the forum.\\nThese included South Korean President Lee Jae-myung, Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney, Japanese Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi and Thai Prime Minister Anutin Charnvirakul.\\nSeparately, Apec member states wrapped up the two-day summit with a joint declaration, pledging to strengthen economic cooperation to navigate the changing global conditions.\\nThe declaration warned that the Asia-Pacific region stood at a “pivotal juncture” and acknowledged that “the global trading system continues to face significant challenges”.\\n“We reaffirm our shared recognition that robust trade and investment are vital to the growth and prosperity of the Asia-Pacific region, and remain committed to deepening economic cooperation to navigate the evolving global environment,” it said.\\n“We acknowledge the importance of a trade and investment environment that promotes resilience and benefits for all.”\\nThe declaration also called for efforts to ensure the resilience of supply chains, and urged cooperation in AI as well as coordination to respond to global challenges including in areas of energy and food security.\\nAdditional reporting by Willa Wu\\n",

            "title": "National Games are just the start, not finishing line, of sporting ambitions",
            "description": "The news that Hong Kong would co-host China’s National Games for the first time, a landmark for the city, was not accompanied by the fanfare that might have been expected when it was announced four years ago.\\nAt the time, the world was still in the grip of the pandemic. Hong Kong’s measures to combat Covid-19, including quarantine and strict social-distancing rules, hit the city’s sports sector hard.\\nIconic events such as the rugby sevens, the marathon and Oxfam Trailwalker were cancelled or scaled down. International competitions moved elsewhere. Sports venues, leagues and gyms closed.\\nThere was, for a time, even a requirement that masks be worn while exercising outdoors. Ever tried running in a mask? I wouldn’t recommend it. Some teams resorted to training sessions via Zoom.\\nThis was a desperate time for Hong Kong sport, with elite athletes and emerging talent deprived of much-needed opportunities to develop.\\nIt was difficult to imagine the city would, even by 2025, be simultaneously hosting multiple sports events watched by tens of thousands of cheering fans, anticipating a haul of medals.\\nThat is why the National Games are important. They are a defining moment in Hong Kong’s post-pandemic recovery.\\nToday’s torch relay through the city’s streets and across the harbour to the new Kai Tak Stadium is a prelude to next Sunday’s opening ceremony in Guangzhou.\\nBut the action is already under way, with beach volleyball at Victoria Park and men’s handball in the Kai Tak Arena.\\nThe show, so far, has been stolen by Nicholas Halliday, who won Hong Kong’s first gold medal last week in a sailing event in Shanwei.\\nIt is, hopefully, the first of many as the city seeks to continue an unexpected winning streak that has helped transform perceptions of sport in Hong Kong and elevate its status.\\nThe government is pumping more money into the sector and an increasing number of elite international competitions are being hosted. Success, it is hoped, will breed success.\\nMomentum started to build shortly before the 2021 announcement that Hong Kong would host the National Games, along with Guangdong and Macau. The city’s performance in the Tokyo summer Olympics that year exceeded expectations.\\nSix medals were won, including a gold for fencer Cheung Ka-long, only the second ever secured by Hong Kong. The surprise success came as a welcome distraction from the pandemic deprivations and political changes of the time.\\nThe medal-winning feats also highlighted what should have been obvious long ago, that sport in the city has great potential – a healthy pursuit, a source of pride and togetherness, a means of improving Hong Kong’s international ties and boosting its economy. It should be a priority.\\nTokyo, it turned out, was just the start. Cheung struck gold again in the Paris Olympics last summer, as did fellow fencer Vivian Kong Man-wai. Swimmer Siobhan Haughey also did the city proud, winning two bronze.\\nHong Kong collected a record haul of medals in the Asian Games in 2023, in sports ranging from cycling to rowing, wushu, athletics and golf. The team returned with eight golds.\\nThere have been more recent achievements, too. Fencer Ryan Choi Chun-yin became the city’s first world champion in July. Tennis player Coleman Wong Chak-lam also made history, reaching the third round of the New York Open in September. And the city’s men’s rugby team have qualified for the World Cup finals for the first time.\\nIt is encouraging that Hong Kong’s young athletes are also performing well. They wrapped up the Asian Youth Games last week with 36 medals, another record, with swimmers leading the way.\\nBut to establish itself as a leading centre for sport – it was ranked 50 in the world this year – the city needs more than good performances. The ability to regularly host elite international events is essential.\\nThe opening of Kai Tak Sports Park in March, with its 50,000-seat stadium, has been described as a game changer, making it much easier to attract top teams and tournaments.\\nA “football festival” featuring famous clubs from England and Italy drew big crowds there in July. Similar high-profile visits are in the pipeline.\\nSnooker, fencing, tennis, golf and table-tennis are among the sports that have chosen Hong Kong for major competitions. The days of pandemic-era isolation are long gone.\\nBut the National Games will pose unprecedented challenges. Hong Kong has wanted to be a co-host ever since returning to China in 1997, first expressing an interest in the 2001 event.\\nThe competition, between teams from across China, will be fierce. There are more than 400 events in 34 sports to be held at 11 Greater Bay Area cities until November 21.\\nHong Kong is hosting eight sports at seven venues. Highlights will include rugby sevens at Kai Tak Stadium, fencing at Kai Tak Arena, and track cycling at the Velodrome, as well as the cross-border marathon and road cycling races.\\nThe city hosted equestrian events for the Beijing Olympics in 2008 and the East Asian Games the following year. But the stakes are even higher for the National Games, considered a source of national pride.\\nMore than 4,000 athletes, officials and media representatives from the mainland need to be suitably accommodated and 100,000 tourists are expected. The city cannot afford anything other than a flawless execution.\\nHong Kong has not always embraced sport so enthusiastically. Parents tend to see academic success as more important and a sports culture has been slow to develop. This needs to change.\\nThe government appears to have woken up to the benefits sport can bring. Beijing, meanwhile, has identified the sector as a key driver of the economy, hoping to double the size of it by 2030.\\nDevelopments in Hong Kong include a much-needed shake-up of the sports associations, some of which operate like private clubs or fiefdoms. Moves intended to bring better corporate governance, inject younger blood and improve areas such as team selection have been put in place. They must be vigorously pursued.\\nHong Kong will need better coaching, training and facilities, as well as stronger support for its emerging and elite athletes if it is to build on what has already been achieved. The city has big ambitions. There is even talk of it bidding to co-host the Olympics along with other Greater Bay Area cities.\\nThe National Games will, if successful both in terms of hosting and performance, mark a significant step forward. But the transformation of the city’s sports scene is a marathon and the finishing line remains a long way away.\\n",

            "description": "Hong Kong reported two imported cases of chikungunya on Saturday, both of whom were hospitalised and are now in stable condition, bringing the total number of cases this year to 54, according to health authorities.\\nThe first case involved a 32-year-old woman living in Sha Tin who had travelled to India between October 9 and 23. She developed a rash and joint pain on the last day of her trip, followed by a fever the next day.\\nShe first consulted a private doctor on October 29 and later went to the accident and emergency department at Prince of Wales Hospital in Sha Tin, where she was admitted the same day and had been receiving treatment in a mosquito-free environment, the Department of Health said.\\nThe second patient is a 32-year-old man who travelled to Macau and Zhuhai with three family members between October 4 and 5. He developed a fever on October 28, followed by a skin rash and significant joint pain in his hands and feet the next day.\\nThe Central and Western district resident first sought medical help at a private hospital and was later admitted to Queen Mary Hospital on Friday, where he is also being treated in a mosquito-free environment.\\n\\n“Although the incubation period for chikungunya fever is generally within two weeks, some infected individuals may experience very mild initial symptoms that go unnoticed,” a government spokesman said, noting that the patient had travelled to an area affected by chikungunya fever about three weeks before the onset of symptoms.\\nThe spokesman added that the patient had not visited the area around Fung Tak Estate in Wong Tai Sin after returning to Hong Kong, where a local case had been detected, and that this was why the possibility of overseas infection was not ruled out.\\nOf the 54 recorded cases of chikungunya so far this year, 52 were imported, with the rest locally acquired. No additional local cases had been detected in the city as of 5pm on Saturday, the government said.\\nMore than 40 countries and regions have reported more than 400,000 cases and 155 deaths this year up to September 30, with infections spread across the Americas, Africa, Asia and Europe. The government stressed that the fatality rate remains below 0.1 per cent.\\nThose aged over 65, infants under one year old, pregnant women and people with chronic illnesses may take longer to recover from chikungunya and could develop complications.\\nThe government urged anyone who developed symptoms – particularly fever, joint pain or rashes – after visiting areas affected by the virus to seek medical advice promptly.\\n",

            "description": "Rare earths will remain an “important card” for China in its relations with the United States, despite the Group of Seven’s commitment to challenge Beijing’s dominance of the critical minerals, according to a Chinese observer.\\nAt a meeting in the Canadian city of Toronto on Friday, G7 energy ministers agreed to establish a critical minerals production alliance.\\nThe plans include more than two dozen new investments, partnerships and measures to accelerate and unlock C$6.4 billion (US$4.57 billion) in critical mineral projects, according to the government department Natural Resources Canada.\\nThe group – which consists of Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom and the United States – also agreed to channel up to C$20.2 million into international collaboration in research and development of the commodities.\\nThese moves “send the world a very clear message”, Canadian Energy Minister Tim Hodgson said, according to Agence France-Presse.\\n“We are serious about reducing market concentration and dependencies,” Hodgson said, referring to China.\\nChina dominates the world’s supply of rare earths, controlling up to 70 per cent of global extraction of the minerals, roughly 85 per cent of refining capacity and about 90 per cent of rare earths metal alloy and magnet production, according to Reuters, citing data from consultancy AlixPartners.\\nOn October 9, China announced fresh restrictions on rare earth exports, adding five more elements to the control list and expanding licensing requirements to cover technologies for mining, processing and manufacturing.\\nThose controls were due to take effect on November 1 but China suspended them for a year following a summit between Chinese President Xi Jinping and his US counterpart Donald Trump on Thursday.\\nAfter the summit, Trump said there was “no roadblock at all” on rare earths.\\n\\n\\nBut before the meeting in Toronto, US Energy Secretary Chris Wright said the Trump administration was fully aligned with the G7 allies on countering China’s market influence.\\nWright accused China of using non-market practices to “squish the rest of the world out of manufacturing those products” to gain strategic leverage.\\n“We need to establish our own ability to mine, process, refine and create the products that come out of rare earth elements,” he said.\\n“We’re going to have to intervene and use some non-market forces.”\\n\\n\\nHowever, Wu Xinbo, dean of Fudan University’s Institute of International Studies, downplayed the threat of that intervention.\\nWu said the non-market strategy – including tariffs, technology suppression, sanctions and export controls – was not new and could be traced back to the Trump administration’s first term.\\n“[The G7] has long wanted to break free from the reliance on Chinese rare earths, but in reality, they can’t do it,” Wu said.\\n“Therefore, I believe that neither market- nor non-market strategies will be successful in the foreseeable future … Rare earths will remain a very important card for China in China-US relations. We have confidence in this.”\\nZhu Feng, executive dean of Nanjing University’s school of international studies, said the G7 summit sent a clear message about the US’ position.\\n“While China and the US have reached a temporary compromise on the trade war now, it is not over and the China-US trade agreement has not yet been officially signed,” Zhu said.\\nHe said that for now the US was seeking to avoid the short-term shock of the ban on the Western industrial system.\\n“The long-term goal is to break free from reliance on China’s rare earth supply chain and value chain. This remains a central component of the strategic competition between China and the US,” Zhu added.\\nHe cautioned that China was naturally concerned about the G7’s plan, as supply chains should be open, diversified and oriented towards market competition.\\n“Allowing geopolitical factors to hijack supply chains will only lead to regression and fragmentation,” Zhu said.\\n",

            "title": "Has a China-Argentina radio telescope been delayed by US political pressure?",
            "description": "A cutting-edge radio telescope built through a long-term partnership between China and Argentina was due to begin peering into the heavens in a few months, but the project is instead staring at lengthy delays – mired in political friction between Beijing and Washington.\\nPerched at the top of a mountain, the China-Argentina Radio Telescope (CART) has been described as a celestial “lighthouse” for Earth’s southern sky. Once operational, the largest single dish telescope in Latin America is expected to reveal new insights about stellar formations, objects such as pulsars and the distant centre of our galaxy.\\nHowever, construction which was set to be completed by next March has been delayed since June after an international agreement was not renewed, leaving components shipped from China held up by Argentine customs.\\nMarcelo Segura, project manager of CART at the National Science and Technical Research Council (CONICET), told the South China Morning Post that the council had stopped supporting the project.\\n“This has given us problems accessing the cargo that has been retained by Argentine customs since September 3,” Segura said.\\n“As a result, we have been unable to assemble the remaining pieces. Everything is hanging by a thread,” said the electric engineer, who has been working on the CART project since 2015.\\n“We have not received any official communication. There is a national government alignment with the United States which reportedly opposes the proliferation of such projects involving Chinese facilities in our country.”\\n\\nSegura is also an associate professor in the electronics department at the National University of San Juan.\\nIn 2012, China and Argentina signed an AR$340 million (US$229,000) agreement to collaborate on the telescope to study electromagnetic radiation emitted by celestial bodies.\\n“Because it is a large-scale project, it would have been optimal for CONICET to be part of it. That way, other science institutions, such as the Argentine Institute of Radio Astronomy or the Large Latin American Millimetre Array, could cooperate,” Segura said.\\nSegura said project officials were hoping for clarity at a meeting set for November 5.\\n“We expect a solution to be discussed at a meeting between Argentine customs and the National University of San Juan. It will be decided there what will happen with the pieces retained,” he said. “There is no justification for the hold-up. We can do nothing until then.”\\nThe Post has contacted Argentina’s foreign ministry, the US embassy in Buenos Aires and CONICET for comment.\\nSegura said the radio telescope was “50 to 60 per cent complete”, with “about 80 per cent” of the assembly finished. Additional receivers were needed to complete the installation.\\n\\n\\n“Now, at least, we have two more months of delay … If we received parts tomorrow, [completion] could be in April or May,” he said.\\nWith a diameter of 40 metres (131 feet), the radio telescope would contribute to the global Very Long Baseline Interferometry, a network of radio telescopes that observes cosmic radio sources in very high angular resolution.\\nIt is designed to function as a versatile “lighthouse” to measure distances, processes and magnetic fields in stellar formations and detect interstellar objects such as pulsars.\\nAccording to an article published by the Argentine Astronomy Association in February: “CART can contribute to pulsar timing, regional line surveys of the major star forming regions, the Magellanic Clouds, the galactic centre and supernova remnants in the southern sky, investigations of planets and comets, and also follow up observations of gamma ray bursts, gravitational waves and other transient phenomena such as fast radio bursts.”\\nThe article was written by Li Jinzeng, a scientist who is part of the CART joint project and head of a collaboration group at the National Astronomical Observatories under the Chinese Academy of Sciences.\\nSegura said CART “was intended for geodesy” – the study of Earth’s shape, dimensions and gravitational field – and was not designed to track satellites.\\n“It is technically impossible for a radio telescope like this to track a satellite, given the speed of both the instrument and the satellite. It simply cannot move fast enough,” he said. “These are technical facts that are very important, but unfortunately not taken into account by those who decide.”\\nEzequiel Zubieta, a PhD student in astronomy at the National University of La Plata, who works on pulsar monitoring at the Argentine Institute of Radio Astronomy under CONICET, agreed that CART could play an important role in the study of geodesy.\\n“It could contribute to global networks, maintain the international celestial reference system by defining coordinates of distant objects, and improve the international land reference system in the southern hemisphere,” he said.\\nSegura said CART could be incorporated into the upper bands of radio astronomy to study radiation in space among other tasks. “Our location, which has low electromagnetic noise and clear skies, allows us to host these kinds of astronomical devices.”\\nLocated in the Felix Aguilar Observatory, the thinner atmosphere at an altitude of 2,400 metres (7,874 feet) will enable CART to receive clearer signals from space.\\nThe site offers exceptional atmospheric stability, low humidity and minimal electromagnetic interference, making it ideal for astronomical research.\\n\\nThe telescope agreement was originally signed by the National University of San Juan, the National Astronomical Observatories of China, CONICET and the government of San Juan in 2015, and has been backed by the International Astronomical Union and the Argentine Astronomy Association.\\n“There is an entire scientific community interested in seeing this project move forward,” Segura said.\\nChina and Argentina have been collaborating on astronomy since 1989, when they agreed to install an automated photo astrolabe used for making highly accurate observations of celestial bodies.\\n“There was also a 30-year cooperation agreement with China that gave it momentum,” Segura said.\\n“This new radio telescope will complement [the satellite laser] and allow us to have better resolution,” Segura said, referring to a previous project with China called the Satellite Laser Ranging System.\\nChina is home to the world’s largest, most sensitive single-dish radio telescope – the Five-hundred-metre Aperture Spherical Telescope (FAST) – located in the southwestern province of Guizhou.\\nFAST, situated in the northern hemisphere, and CART in the southern hemisphere could complement each other by conducting similar tasks in different wavelengths. FAST operates between 70 megahertz and 3 gigahertz, while CART runs between 1 and 45 gigahertz.\\nCART could also complement the Atacama Large Millimetre Array, located in Chile.\\nThis interferometer, comprising 66 dishes, operates at similar latitudes to CART but uses higher frequencies, allowing it to detect hot gases and magnetic fields.\\n",

            "title": "EU welcomes pause in rare earth controls as US-China deal overshadows Brussels talks",
            "description": "The European Union welcomed China’s suspension of expanded rare earth restrictions imposed last month, even as crisis talks in Brussels on Friday appeared to yield no relief for European firms still constrained by the original export controls.\\nAfter a full day of talks in the Belgian capital, the European Commission described the pause in controls – announced following US-China talks in South Korea on Thursday – as an “appropriate and responsible step in the context of ensuring stable global trade flows in a critically important area”.\\nCommission spokesman Olof Gill said on Saturday that the sides had “discussed how to maintain supply chain stability in relation to rare earths and committed to further engage on licensing facilitation measures, including general licences”.\\nBut with a string of breakthroughs from Thursday’s summit between Chinese and US leaders already shaping the global trade landscape and Europe’s place in it, the Brussels talks appeared little more than a sideshow.\\nEarlier on Saturday, Beijing announced that it would consider removing export controls on the Netherlands-based semiconductor maker Nexperia. The controls were imposed after the Dutch government effectively seized control of the Chinese-owned company on September 30.\\nMedia reports, meanwhile, suggested that the White House was preparing to announce that the Dutch arm of Nexperia would resume sending chips to its Chinese processing and testing facility in Dongguan. The move would be welcomed by the global automotive industry, which warned of production shutdowns if supplies remained halted.\\nMilan Captein, spokesman for the Dutch ministry of economic affairs, declined to comment on the reports but said the ministry was working with Chinese authorities and international partners towards a “constructive resolution that restores balance to the chip supply chain”.\\nAfter Chinese President Xi Jinping’s 100-minute summit with US President Donald Trump in Busan, Beijing’s commerce ministry confirmed that an expansion of the rare earth export controls announced on October 9 would be paused. In exchange, the US ceased an expansion of its blacklist of Chinese companies that would cover subsidiaries 50 per cent owned by listed entities for the same period.\\nSpeaking to reporters in Rome on Friday, EU trade chief Maros Sefcovic confirmed that the pause would benefit Europe, too.\\n“My understanding is that the agreement, which was found between the US and China in this matter, is ‘erga omnes’, so we should apply it to all and, of course, including the European Union,” he said, according to Agence France-Presse.\\nSefcovic added that he would speak to Chinese Commerce Minister Wang Wentao “very, very soon”.\\n\\n\\nNonetheless, Beijing’s restrictions dating back to April, which require companies to obtain licences before exporting rare earths, remain in place and have roiled EU industries. Since August, European companies have complained that some production has been halted over a shortage of rare earths, which are vital to many areas of advanced manufacturing.\\nThe twin developments on rare earths and Nexperia underscored that Washington and Beijing remain the ultimate arbiters of the global trade dispute and emphasised Europe’s uncomfortable position, sandwiched between the two giants.\\nInside the commission, discussions are ongoing about a new trade rule that could force some Chinese exporters to provide rare earths and other critical materials when they ship goods to Europe. Simultaneously, officials are discussing whether to weaponise Europe’s own export chokepoints to unpick Beijing’s controls.\\nThe plans, first reported on Friday by Bloomberg, are all in embryonic form, with multiple proposals circulating among European commissioners’ cabinets, according to sources. There is uncertainty as to whether an entirely new trade instrument is required.\\nHowever, this could eat up months, if not years – a time frame that emphasises how the EU’s legalistic approach jars with the US and China’s more muscular and often lightning-fast approach to weaponised trade.\\nOn Friday, EU digital chief Henna Virkkunen held meetings with Nexperia representatives, after which she affirmed that the bloc was hoping to secure a negotiated solution to the crisis. In her statements, there was no suggestion that the Busan talks would deliver a potential resolution.\\n“I reaffirmed our determination to work towards a diplomatic breakthrough. We discussed potential short- and medium-term measures to strengthen the resilience of our supply chain,” Virkkunen said.\\nWhile the Dutch government insists it was not acting under duress when it moved to ring-fence Nexperia from its Chinese owners, court documents showed that the US pressured The Hague to change the company’s management or else face being added to the expanded entity list.\\n“We know that all parties to this dispute are working very hard to find a diplomatic solution. At the same time, our members are telling us that part supplies are already being stopped due to the shortage,” said Sigrid de Vries, director general of the European Automobile Manufacturers’ Association, on Wednesday.\\n“This means assembly line stoppages might only be days away. We urge all involved to redouble their efforts to find a diplomatic way out of this critical situation.”\\n",

            "description": "Hong Kong customs has seized 35kg (77lbs) of suspected ketamine worth HK$16 million (US$2 million) hidden in a mini-storage warehouse, arresting one man as part of a joint operation with Chinese authorities.\\nAngus Lin, senior investigator of the Customs and Excise Department’s drug investigation division, revealed on Saturday that a 49-year-old man had been arrested on Friday after officers discovered two batches of suspected ketamine sent to the same recipient at a mini-storage facility in Sai Wan on Monday and Tuesday.\\n“We suspect some syndicate members have been abusing the service for receiving goods on behalf of customers to store drugs temporarily, in order to avoid being arrested for handling drugs,” Lin said.\\nActing on intelligence shared by anti-smuggling authorities from mainland China, officers searched a shipment of goods at the storage facility inside an industrial building in Sai Wan on Monday.\\n\\nThey discovered 10kg of suspected ketamine concealed inside four plastic buckets.\\nThe following day, customs officers intercepted another shipment from Germany that was declared as component parts for an undisclosed type of equipment. It was sent to the same recipient at the mini-storage facility.\\nUpon opening nine transparent plastic bags, officers found 25kg of suspected ketamine.\\nThe two batches, with a total street value of HK$16 million, were seized.\\n“The recipient had registered an account with the mini-storage facility, then asked for a receiving service for the packages while controlling the whole logistics process from behind the scenes,” Lin said.\\nOfficers arrested a 49-year-old man linked to the case on Friday for trafficking in dangerous drugs.\\nUnder Hong Kong law, the maximum penalty for drug trafficking is life imprisonment and a fine of HK$5 million.\\n",

            "description": "Tom McKibbin’s seemingly inevitable march to the Link Hong Kong Open title hit an MJ Maguire-sized speed bump on Saturday, and a shoot-out now beckons for the spoils that will go to the victor.\\nAhead since the start of the tournament, the Northern Irishman’s cushion is down to a shot, after his second successive 65 was more than matched by Maguire’s nine-under-par 61, which moved him to 19 under for the tournament.\\nPeter Uihlein is a stroke further back in third, while the evergreen Scott Hend, who won at Hong Kong Golf Club in 2014, and Kiradech Aphibarnrat round out the top five on 17 under after carding 64 and 66 respectively.\\nAll are chasing the green-and-gold pot at the end of the rainbow, with a spot in next year’s Masters and the 154th Open Championship up for grabs alongside the US$360,000 (HK$2.8 million) first prize.\\n\\n“Everyone came here knowing the spots were available, and there’s no big deal in finishing second or third,” McKibbin said. “I came here with the mindset of just trying to give it a good go, and hopefully I can do that tomorrow.”\\nMaguire, meanwhile, was going steadily along at three under until he punched an eight iron out from among some trees on the par-four 11th and it rolled in for an eagle. Four birdies in his closing seven holes dragged him into a conversation he had not been part of for the first two days.\\nVictory on Sunday would probably lift the American into the top five in the International Series Rankings, adding an extra layer of pressure to his final round.\\n“There’s definitely a lot to play for,” Maguire said. “So I’ll just try and play it one shot at a time and stay focused.”\\nFurther down the field, and not for the first time in his career, Jason Hak Shun-yat will be Hong Kong’s lone representative on the final day of his home Open.\\nThe 31-year-old’s two-under 68 in the third round took him to seven under overall, and it could have been better if not for the bogey on 18 when a putt he thought was going left broke right instead.\\n“I think it’s one of the lowest cut lines [four under] that I’ve played,” Hak said. “There are a lot of great players, there are major champions, Ryder Cup players, and I feel good to compete with some of the best.”\\nHak will be back at Fanling again in two weeks for the National Games, although then his only focus will be helping the team win. Rules dictate that only two of the four-man squad can compete for individual glory, and this time that will be Taichi Kho and Matthew Cheung.\\nAlready the owner of a team silver medal from the 2013 Games, and with a fourth-place finish in 2021 under his belt, Hak would have been forgiven for feeling aggrieved at the decision to bench him in favour of Kho and Cheung, both of whom missed the cut this week.\\n“Obviously team comes first before the individual,” Hak said. “We have four great players, all can shoot low scores out there, so it doesn’t matter who plays for a stroke or the team, we’re all playing for the team.”\\n",
