            "description": "Chinese toymaker Pop Mart, maker of the Labubu monster dolls, is expanding into the Middle East with the opening of its first store in the region, marking a significant milestone in its international growth.\\nLaunched in partnership with Qatar Duty Free (QDF), the new store is situated in the North Node area of Hamad International Airport in Doha, Qatar’s capital. It features a selection of travel-themed exclusive collectibles, including card holders, travel pillows and bags.\\nThe outlet, which opened its doors on Tuesday, is the first Pop Mart location to operate 24/7.\\n“This new store is a testament to our commitment to meeting fans wherever they are,” said Justin Moon, senior vice-president and chief operating officer of Pop Mart.\\n“Pop Mart adds a new dimension of creativity and fun to our retail mix,” said Thabet Musleh, chief retail and hospitality officer with QDF owner Qatar Airways Group.\\n\\nFounded by millennial entrepreneur Wang Ning in 2010, Pop Mart began with the concept of selling toys in so-called blind boxes, which conceal their content in opaque wrappings.\\nThe company has since evolved from a seller of plush toys and fridge magnets in Beijing’s Zhongguancun area to become the world’s largest toy company by market value.\\nPop Mart’s Hong Kong-listed shares rose 0.7 per cent to close at HK$229.80 on Thursday, pushing its market capitalisation to HK$308.6 billion (US$39.7 billion). While that has decreased from more than US$400 billion in August, it still exceeded the combined market value of Hasbro, Mattel and Sanrio.\\nPop Mart’s best-known series, Labubu, has captured the hearts of celebrities including Rihanna, Kim Kardashian, David Beckham, Awkwafina and Lisa from the South Korean girl group Blackpink. The exposure has boosted Labubu’s global popularity.\\nPop Mart began international sales around 2018 via online channels. In 2020, it opened its first overseas store in Seoul.\\nRevenue from its overseas operations surged between 365 per cent and 370 per cent year on year in the third quarter, according to the firm’s earnings preview released last week.\\nSales from the Americas grew more than 13-fold from a year ago, while revenue from Europe jumped more than eight-fold. Sales in Asia more than doubled.\\nLabubu is also gaining traction in the Middle East.\\nGoogle Trends data indicated a surge in interest in the United Arab Emirates following the launch of a new Labubu series in April. Among the largest emirates, Dubai, Abu Dhabi and Sharjah exhibited the strongest interest.\\nIn an interview with the People’s Daily in July, founder and chairman Wang said he expected overseas revenue to surpass domestic sales by the end of this year.\\n",

            "description": "Global gold demand hit a record high in the third quarter of 2025, the World Gold Council said in a new report, adding that it remained upbeat about the outlook for the precious metal.\\nThe findings came amid a recent pullback in gold prices after a months-long rally that had sent it to record highs.\\nGold demand reached 1,313 tonnes – or about US$146 billion in value terms – between July and September, the highest quarterly total on record, according to the report released by the trade association on Thursday.\\nThe report attributed the rise primarily to surging investment demand driven by “a powerful combination of an uncertain and volatile geopolitical environment, US dollar weakness and investor FOMO [fear of missing out] as the price climbed higher”.\\nThat led total gold demand to soar 44 per cent in value terms from the same period last year in the third quarter, while demand rose by a modest 3 per cent year on year in volume terms, the report said.\\n“With the record high level of gold demand and prices in the third quarter of 2025, we expect gold demand to remain strong,” said Fan Shaokai, head of Asia-Pacific (ex-China) and global head of central banks at the World Gold Council, in a press release issued on Thursday.\\nFan added that the association expected central banks to “continue their buying streak” and that the metal would retain “its lustre as a resilient option for a growing pool of investors looking to diversify”.\\n\\n\\nAccording to the report, investment demand grew by 47 per cent year on year in the third quarter, reaching 537 tonnes and accounting for 55 per cent of overall net gold demand.\\nNet purchases by central banks in the third quarter reached 220 tonnes – up 28 per cent from the previous quarter and 10 per cent year on year – despite record-high prices, the report noted.\\nGold prices underwent a decisive pullback last week after the spot price peaked at more than US$4,380 per ounce – a gain of over 60 per cent since the end of last year. The spot price was up 1.9 per cent for the day at just under US$4,004 as of Thursday afternoon, according to financial data provider Wind.\\nThe World Gold Council stressed that the environment remained favourable for gold to continue attracting buyers.\\n“Continued US dollar weakness, lower interest rate expectations and the threat of stagflation could further propel investment demand,” said Louise Street, a senior markets analyst at the association.\\n“Our research indicates the market is not yet saturated and the strategic case to hold gold remains firmly in place.”\\n",

            "description": "With smiles, firm handshakes and warm gestures, Chinese President Xi Jinping and his US counterpart Donald Trump set a cordial, friendly tone before their historic summit. More than an hour and a half later, they emerged from their first face-to-face encounter in six years with the same genial manner.\\nIn front of reporters, ahead of the meeting in Busan, South Korea, a grinning Trump predicted the summit would be “very successful”. “He’s a tough negotiator – that’s not good,” he said, before giving the Chinese leader a friendly pat on the back.\\nTrump referred to Xi as his “friend”, praising him as a “very distinguished and respected president” and “a great leader of a great country”. After they sat down face-to-face, Trump said he was optimistic about their future ties: “I expect we’ll have a fantastic relationship for a long period of time.”\\nXi reciprocated the sentiment in his opening remarks, saying he felt a “warm” sense upon seeing Trump again.\\n\\n\\nAfter the summit concluded 100 minutes later, Trump and Xi walked out together at Gimhae Air Base and smiled before sharing a final handshake. Trump whispered something to Xi before walking the Chinese leader to his car.\\nThe two leaders had already finalised a series of agreements, ranging from the US reducing its fentanyl-related tariffs on China by 10 percentage points with immediate effect to postponing its Section 301 investigation into Chinese shipbuilding.\\nMeanwhile, China will suspend a set of new rare earth export controls it announced this month for one year, as well as its corresponding measures against the US shipbuilding investigation.\\n\\nTrump told reporters on the flight back to the United States that he would visit China in April.\\nBoth leaders were accompanied by several high-level officials. On the Chinese side was Foreign Minister Wang Yi, his deputy Ma Zhaoxu, Commerce Minister Wang Wentao, Vice-Premier He Lifeng, Xi’s chief of staff Cai Qi, and National Development and Reform Commission chairman Zheng Shanjie.\\nOn the American side was US Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, Trade Representative Jamieson Greer, chief of staff Susie Wiles, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, and David Perdue, the US ambassador to China.\\nXi arrived in Busan on Thursday morning for the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (Apec) summit to be held in Gyeongju. Trump skipped the gathering after attending some events with business leaders on Wednesday.\\nThe meeting venue – a grey building with a light blue rooftop near Gimhae International Airport – is heavily secured. Barbed wire fences make the site inaccessible to the public and most media, with heightened security serving as the only visible sign of the leaders’ presence.\\nSeoul struck a balance for the reception ceremony for the two leaders in Busan, with both arrivals treated as a state visit. South Korean Foreign Minister Cho Hyun greeted them separately at the airport.\\nA red carpet was rolled out for Xi’s arrival, with honour guards lining up and a 21-gun salute. Xi arrived at the summit venue in a Chinese-made Hongqi vehicle.\\nTrump had arrived in South Korea a day earlier. He also received a 21-gun salute, while a South Korean military band performed “Y.M.C.A.”, a 1970s hit song that became a staple at Trump’s campaign rallies.\\n",

            "title": "German scents exhibition combines 1,000 years of fragrances with art and history",
            "description": "Ever wondered what war smells like? Or pondered the odour of love, the stench of medieval Paris, or the fragrance of religion?\\nA new exhibition in Germany allows visitors to discover unknown smells by sniffing their way through 81 different fragrances across 37 different galleries.\\nThe show “The Secret Power of Scents”, which opened to the public on Wednesday at the Kunstpalast museum in the city of Duesseldorf, combines fragrances with art, taking visitors on a journey of more than 1,000 years of cultural history.\\n“This exhibition is an experiment – and an invitation for our audience to discover the history of scents with their noses,” says Felix Kraemer, the museum’s director general.\\nThe exhibition follows a chronological order, from religious artefacts of the Middle Ages through to contemporary art of the 21st century. The galleries are equipped with atomisers and diffusers to create a connection between the art and the smell of a specific time period or cultural context.\\nThe scent of myrrh wafts through a darkened gallery of Christian wood carvings depicting various scenes from the Bible. Christianity, Judaism and Islam all used myrrh as a symbol for prayer and purification, the show explains.\\n\\nSmell evokes stronger emotional reactions than any other sense. It comes as no surprise that visitors almost retreat in fear when they press a button in a gallery depicting war from World War I. The scent was created by mixing the pungent smell of gunpowder with the metallic odour of blood and sulphur.\\n“Anyone who has ever experienced war, conventional war, will hate it, because you can actually smell the brutality of war here,” says Robert Mueller-Gruenow, the show’s curator and a leading expert in the field of scent and scent technology.\\n“It’s the first exhibition worldwide to bring scents into a museum in this form, format and scale,” he says.\\nOn the other side of the fragrance spectrum, there is the Venus and Adonis painting from 1610 by Flemish artist Peter Paul Rubens, showing two lovers.\\n“This room is all about passion and emotions,” Mueller-Gruenow says, adding that the smells diffused here are dominated by roses and the scent of the civet – a cat whose scent was considered erotic in the 17th century, but makes today’s visitors turn up their noses in disgust.\\nCertain smells also connect to different eras of history; pressing the button to release the stench of medieval Paris makes some visitors choke when they inhale a mix of sewage, mould and unwashed bodies.\\n\\nOn the other hand, in a gallery dedicated to the Roaring Twenties, there is an oil painting by Gert Heinrich Wollheim from 1924, which celebrates the liberation of women, who at the time began wearing bold lipstick, bobbed their hair and smoked cigarettes in public. The room is filled with the uplifting scent of tobacco, vanilla and leather – a mixture that is a nod to famous early fragrances such as the historic Tabac Blond, which was launched by the fragrance house Caron in 1919.\\nMoving on to modern art, the museum presents more contemporary smells between works of Andy Warhol, Yves Klein or Guenther Uecker, that remind visitors of world-famous brands such as Coca-Cola or German airline Eurowings, which diffuses a pleasant and relaxing scent on the plane when passengers board.\\nIn addition to the application of scents in marketing, the museum also shows the role of very modern scents such as the fragrance molecule “Iso E Super”, a dazzling scent that supposedly makes its wearers more attractive.\\n“It’s a fragrance that smells like cedarwood, but it also has something very velvety and skin-like about it,” says the curator. “It smells very human, warm and flatteringly approachable.”\\nFor visitors strolling and sniffing their way through the show, which runs until March 8 next year, the 81 different scents opened up a whole new world, visitor Kirsten Gnoth says.\\n“I’ve been to the collection here before, but now it’s completely new with scents that match the pictures and eras,” she says. “It’s exciting to combine art with scents.”\\n",

            "description": "The University of Hong Kong has pioneered a first-of-its-kind clinical trial that integrates lipofilling surgical practices with breast conservation, providing a new solution for cancer patients that promises to improve their well-being post-operation.\\nThe preliminary findings released on Thursday by the university’s Li Ka Shing Faculty of Medicine also showed that breast cancer patients who underwent the procedure showed no signs of immediate surgical complications or recurrence of the disease.\\n“One of the biggest fears for many women diagnosed with breast cancer is the possibility of losing their breasts,” said Ava Kwong Hoi-wai, a clinical professor and breast cancer researcher who led the university’s study.\\n“Our goal is to expand the treatment options for patients suitable for breast-conserving surgery to improve post-operative breast symmetry and natural appearance – ultimately improving patients’ confidence and quality of life,” she said.\\nBreast cancer was the most common form of cancer among women in Hong Kong in 2022, according to the Centre for Health Protection. It was also the third leading cause of cancer-related deaths among women in 2023.\\nWhile a mastectomy, or breast removal surgery, has traditionally been the most common form of treatment for breast cancer, women are increasingly receiving a type of conserving surgery where parts of the surrounding tissue are used to reshape the breast after the tumour has been removed.\\nBut Kwong said such treatments could still result in large scars or a smaller post-operation breast shape, depending on the size of the tumour and the amount of surrounding tissue, which was particularly a problem among Asian patients.\\nLooking for a solution, Kwong’s team launched clinical trials in 2024 for a relatively newer treatment for breast cancer patients that integrates lipofilling techniques into breast-conserving surgery.\\nLipofilling is a form of surgery similar to liposuction, whereby fat is removed from one part of the body and injected into another part to add volume or restore its shape.\\n\\nKwong said that while lipofilling breast reconstruction was already available at some private medical institutions in Hong Kong, most procedures were for women who had already undergone a mastectomy or another form of breast reconstruction surgery.\\nInstead, the clinical trial allowed for patients to undergo both the tumour removal and breast reconstruction in one surgery, rather than spreading the procedures over two or three operations.\\nThe study also marked the first randomised control trial for the procedure in the world, and also the first using Asian patients, Kwong said.\\nPrevious studies into the feasibility of the procedure had been localised to Western countries, she said.\\nFifteen women have already undergone the procedure as part of the trial, with none having experienced cancer recurrence.\\nWomen who underwent the lipofilling procedure showed an average 10 per cent increase in breast volume compared with the 12 per cent reduction observed in the control group.\\nTo measure patients’ overall health and well-being, the team used Breast-Q, a widely used patient-reported measure for breast cancer outcomes.\\nThe team found that women who received the lipofilling procedure gave higher median scores in terms of psychological well-being, sexual well-being and satisfaction with their breasts compared with the conventional group.\\nKwong said the team ultimately hoped to perform their procedure on 48 breast cancer patients, and encouraged patients to sign up.\\n",

            "description": "ChangXin Memory Technologies (CXMT), China’s leading memory chipmaker, has started mass production of a new generation of DRAM products in the latest sign of the country’s advancing semiconductor capabilities.\\nThe Hefei-based company, which is preparing for an initial public offering in Shanghai, announced on its official website that it had begun producing LPDDR5X – an advanced type of DRAM widely used in mobile devices.\\nDRAM chips function as high-speed memory in artificial intelligence systems, allowing rapid storage and access to the vast amounts of data required for AI model training and inference.\\nCXMT’s move marks its entry into the global arena for advanced memory chips, a market long dominated by South Korea’s Samsung Electronics and SK Hynix, as well as US-based Micron Technology.\\nThe company’s LPDDR5X range includes chips with speeds of 8,533 Mbps, 9,600 Mbps and 10,667 Mbps. Mass production of the first two models began in May, while the fastest version was currently in the “customer sampling” stage, CXMT said in the statement.\\nThe LPDDR5X series is an upgrade on CXMT’s LPDDR5 line-up, offering faster data transfer rates and lower power consumption. The firm launched its LPDDR5 family in 2023, including 12Gb dies and 6GB and 12GB mobile DRAM packages.\\n\\nSamsung in April last year unveiled an LPDDR5X DRAM that it said achieved industry-leading performance of up to 10.7 Gbps, and began mass production of its 12-nanometre LPDDR5X DRAM packages in August last year.\\nCXMT’s latest products underscore the company’s ambition to boost its supply of high-end memory chips amid a global shortage driven by soaring AI demand.\\nGlobal DRAM industry revenue rose 17.1 per cent quarter on quarter to US$31.63 billion in the second quarter, fuelled by higher contract prices for conventional DRAM and expanding shipments of high-bandwidth memory, according to consultancy TrendForce.\\nThe announcement also comes as CXMT moves closer to a long-anticipated IPO on the mainland. The company aimed to list in Shanghai as early as the first quarter of 2026, seeking a valuation of up to 300 billion yuan (US$41 billion), Reuters reported earlier this month, citing people familiar with the matter.\\nIn July, CXMT filed for IPO counselling with the China Securities Regulatory Commission, a required step before companies can seek a domestic listing.\\nFounded in 2016, the company has advanced its manufacturing to the 16-nm process with a new 16-gigabit DDR5 chip, narrowing the technology gap with industry leaders, according to a January report by semiconductor research firm TechInsights.\\n",

            "description": "Sailing was never Nicholas Halliday’s first love, with his mother the driving force that initially got him onto the sea and on Wednesday made him a National Games gold medallist.\\nThe 26-year-old claimed the ILCA 7 title in the waters around the city of Shanwei, and then admitted it was on land that he felt most at home when he was a child.\\n“At that time, I didn’t think I really liked sailing,” he said. “I enjoyed the feeling on the rugby fields and basketball courts more.”\\nHalliday’s journey to the podium began around the age of eight or nine, when his mother Suzanna, a keen sailor, consistently enrolled him in training courses with the Hebe Dragons, where he shared a private coach with other youngsters.\\nThings changed quickly though. From a child who was not fond of going out onto the sea, Halliday’s love for the sport developed through the friendships he made and when he began to show his potential.\\n\\nFrom being determined to be on the court, he would even turn down game invitations from his basketball coach, just so he could take part in the sailing team’s training at weekends.\\nBorn on June 18, 1999, in Hong Kong to American parents Brian and Suzanna Bezy from San Diego, the King George V School graduate was raised in the city, and at 15 began to represent his home competitively.\\nThree years later, he was selected to represent Hong Kong at the Asian Games in Jakarta, and that was when his Chinese name, pronounced Bei Jun-long, was decided “in a matter of minutes”.\\n“I was 18 and wanted to go to the Asian Games, so I changed my passport and wanted to have a Chinese name,” Halliday said in an interview last year before the Paris Olympics. “I came down to Hong Kong Sports Institute and talked to my strength trainer, and we sat down and came up with this name.\\n“We felt Long [which means ‘dragon’ in Chinese] sounded cool, it also felt good to be handsome [yingjun], so we went with Jun, and Bei was a direct translation from my previous last name Bezy.”\\nHalliday officially changed his surname to that of his Scottish stepfather, Cameron Halliday, after the Asian Games in Hangzhou.\\nAfter finishing seventh in Indonesia, a pair of bronze medals followed at the ASAF Asian Sailing Championships and ILCA Asian Open Championship in February and December 2022, but an Asian Games medal remained elusive, with Halliday finishing just outside the podium places in Hangzhou a year later.\\nThe wind appeared to be on his side thereafter. In December 2023, the then 24-year-old Halliday finished first at the Asian Sailing Championships in Pattaya, which doubled as a Continental qualifier for the Paris Olympics, to become the first sailor from Hong Kong to qualify for the men’s single dinghy event at any Games.\\n“[Qualifying for the Olympics has] been a goal of mine since I was a kid – I’ve been trying to go for it since Tokyo,” Halliday said last year. “It’s my first time. I don’t really have any expectations, except just to give it the best I got.\\n“I’m just going to see where I end up from there, and learn as much as I can from the top competitors.”\\nAfter finishing 24th, among 43 sailors worldwide, at the Marseille Marina last summer, Halliday added a runner-up finish and a winner medal at the ILCA Asian &amp; Open Championships last December and in June, with a historic win on the Sailing Grand Slam circuit, contested between Olympic sailors, sandwiched between.\\nLooking ahead, his overarching goal is to improve significantly on his showing at the Paris Olympics at the next Games in Los Angeles in 2028.\\n“Sailing is just one person facing the sea, the wind, and their opponents,” said Halliday. “We have no idea what we will face next, and don’t know what we’ll get.\\n“We can only do our best to control and get what we want.”\\n",

            "title": "Indonesia’s Prabowo turns to podcasts for reality check: ‘am I really authoritarian?’",
            "description": "Indonesian President Prabowo Subianto has admitted watching podcasts about himself on his smartphone at night – and while some of the portrayals irk him, he believes that criticism is good for keeping politicians like him in check.\\n“Sometimes at night, I watch podcasts. And yes, some of them can be irritating. I find myself thinking: ‘What is this?’ But I take note anyway,” Prabowo said at a National Police event on Wednesday, as quoted by Tempo news magazine.\\nOne of the recurring claims about the former general is that he is authoritarian, a charge he has denied. “I watch those podcasts and ask myself: ‘Am I really authoritarian?’ I don’t think so,” he said with a smile, according to the Jakarta Globe newspaper.\\nPrabowo said the podcasts helped him reflect, noting that politicians who did not listen to criticism were easily led astray.\\n“I have a philosophy that in serving the nation, we must not be driven by anger or resentment,” he said, according to Kompas newspaper. “When I’m attacked, I tell the younger generation who aspire to become presidents: don’t be afraid of slander. Don’t ignore correction.”\\n\\n\\nHe developed this positive attitude towards criticism and slander while in school. “I was slandered about two to three times. I was so down I complained to a teacher,” he said, according to news portal Detik.\\nThe teacher told him: “Don’t lose heart. If people slander you, it means you’re being noticed, maybe even feared. Take it as a sign to stay alert.”\\nThis is not the first time the Indonesian president has spoken about learning from podcasts. At the Indonesian Solidarity Party Congress on July 20, he said he often checked social media and podcasts about him.\\n“I sometimes scroll through social media at night and watch podcasts to see what people are saying about me. Funny thing is, sometimes they seem to know more about Prabowo than I do,” he joked, as quoted by Tempo.\\nDespite his lighthearted attempt to shrug off his naysayers, Prabowo’s administration has come under fire in recent times.\\nOf the 976 respondents who voted for Prabowo and Vice-President Gibran Rakabuming Raka last year, only 643 said they would do so again, the Centre of Economic and Law Studies revealed on Saturday.\\nThe centre attributed the 34 per cent drop to dissatisfaction over economic performance, governance and law enforcement, the Jakarta Globe reported.\\nIn September, Prabowo had to replace five ministers in a lightning cabinet reshuffle after deadly protests erupted over ministerial pay.\\n\\nAnother ongoing issue is his flagship free meals programme for students and pregnant women, which has been plagued by a spate of food poisoning cases since it rolled out in January. As of Wednesday, 15,000 children had fallen ill, Reuters reported, citing data from a non-governmental organisation known locally as JPPI.\\nPrabowo defended it on October 18, saying that out of the 1.4 billion meals distributed nationwide, there were 8,000 cases of food poisoning reported. “That’s about 0.0007 or 0.0008 per cent, which means the programme has been 99.99 per cent successful,” he said, according to Antara news agency.\\n“So far, a few thousand children have suffered mild food poisoning, but what gets amplified is the poisoning issue – as if the entire programme should be stopped.”\\nDespite this, the president remains popular with Indonesians. According to a Lingkaran Survei Indonesia (LSI) poll released earlier this month, public satisfaction with Prabowo’s performance stood at 74.8 per cent.\\n“Although the satisfaction rate has declined compared to January and June 2025, remaining above 70 per cent is a positive signal for the government,” LSI Executive Director Adjie Alfarabi said, as quoted by the Jakarta Globe.\\n",

            "description": "South Korean President Lee Jae-myung said Seoul aimed to work with Beijing to advance practical cooperation in trade, supply chains and people-to-people exchanges to improve ties based on “friendly competition” and “equal cooperation”.\\nLee made the remarks in an interview with China’s state-run Xinhua news agency published a day ahead of Chinese President Xi Jinping’s arrival in the South Korean city of Busan on Thursday. This marks Xi’s first visit to South Korea in 11 years, following his last trip in July 2014.\\nLee is expected to hold a summit with Xi on Saturday in the coastal city of Gyeongju on the sidelines of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (Apec) summit.\\nIn the interview, Lee expressed hopes of advancing the “mature development” of bilateral ties, while noting that as China’s industrial competitiveness and hi-tech capabilities rose sharply, competition between businesses in the two countries had grown.\\n“However, I believe South Korea and China can pool wisdom to mature and advance the strategic partnership based on ‘friendly competition’ and ‘equal cooperation’,” he said, according to the Xinhua report.\\n“In particular, I believe there is an urgent need to explore new complementary cooperation models in economic and trade sectors to further energise enterprises and industries in both countries.”\\nXi’s visit comes as Seoul finds itself caught in the middle of a deepening US-China rivalry. While South Korea relies on the US for security protection, China is its biggest trading partner.\\nOn the sidelines of the Apec summit on Thursday, Xi held talks with his American counterpart Donald Trump in their first in-person meeting since the latter’s return to the White House earlier this year.\\n\\nIn the Xinhua interview, Lee highlighted the importance of promoting mutually beneficial trade and supply chain collaboration and delivering tangible benefits for the peoples of both countries.\\nSeoul also aims to expand practical cooperation in areas such as culture, environment and people-to-people exchanges while addressing regional security issues, including denuclearisation on the Korean peninsula, according to Lee.\\nIn recent years, China’s strengthened manufacturing capabilities have put South Korean shipbuilders and carmakers under pressure. Meanwhile, Seoul has increasingly aligned itself with Washington on hi-tech industries, particularly semiconductors.\\nIn the past two years, Chinese shipbuilders have secured about 70 per cent of new vessel orders globally, while South Korea’s market share has fallen to an eight-year low, according to a research institute affiliated with China State Shipbuilding Corporation.\\nSouth Korean brands Hyundai and Kia have lost market share to Chinese electric car producers.\\nLee said that the two sides could expand consultation channels for economic and trade cooperation and accelerate negotiations to achieve progress in the investment sector.\\n“The two countries agree that supply chain cooperation should continue to be strengthened, and through this consensus, the peoples of both countries will directly benefit,” Lee said in the interview.\\nSouth Korea is one of the few developed nations to have signed a free trade deal with China. It, together with Japan, is also a member of the China-led Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership.\\nNoting that he had visited China multiple times, Lee said that “China’s rich culture and economic development have left a profound impression on me and allow me to envision a bright future for South Korea–China relations”.\\nHe added that it was especially important for the two countries’ leaders to deepen political trust and maintain strategic communication through mutual visits.\\nRegarding the situation on the Korean peninsula, Lee stated that Seoul would strengthen strategic communication with Beijing.\\n“For substantive solutions to the nuclear problem and the construction of peace on the Korean peninsula, we urgently need China to play a constructive role,” he said.\\nAs for the Apec summit, Lee noted that most of the forum’s members faced common challenges and could improve cooperation and dialogue.\\nHe said that when it came to artificial intelligence (AI) and addressing demographic changes, the efforts of a single economy were limited.\\n“The best solutions emerge when all parties gather, share exemplary policies and discuss diverse policy options,” he said.\\n“I will work closely with Apec members, including China, to make Apec not only a forum for trade and investment discussions but also a multilateral platform for future economic and trade issues such as AI and demographic change.”\\n",
