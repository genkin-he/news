            "title": "Indonesia still ‘considering’ buying Chinese J-10 fighter jets to modernise its military",
            "description": "Indonesia is still “considering” acquiring Chinese J-10 fighter jets, but no decision has been made yet, according to Jakarta’s Ministry of Defence, clarifying earlier reports that the country was set to buy up to 42 units to modernise its military.\\n“It’s still being analysed and reviewed. At the moment, we are considering all platforms that can fulfil our need to help guard our sovereignty and territorial integrity,” ministry spokesman Brigadier General Frega Wenas Inkiriwang said.\\nOn October 16, local and newswire agencies quoted Indonesian Defence Minister Sjafrie Sjamsoeddin as saying the J-10 “will be flying in Jakarta shortly” but gave no details.\\nThe following week, Sjamsoeddin said Indonesian President Prabowo Subianto, as the supreme commander of the armed forces, would be the one to decide whether to buy the J-10s, according to local news outlet Tempo. Prabowo has not made a decision.\\nObservers say the J-10s would be cheaper than other fighters on the market but adding them to the Indonesian Air Force would complicate operations within its own military and with the armed forces of other countries.\\n\\nFirst developed by Chengdu Aircraft Corporation in the 1980s as China’s third-generation fighter jet, the J-10 series has in recent years been upgraded to the 4.5-generation J-10C and become one of Beijing’s major defence industry products.\\nDubbed the “Vigorous Dragon”, the fourth-generation fighter is equipped with active electronically scanned array radar and advanced air-to-air missiles like the PL-15.\\nIf Indonesia did go ahead and buy the aircraft, it would be China’s first sale of military hardware to the Southeast Asian giant.\\nIndonesia has 110 fighter planes in total, including American F-16s, Russian Su-27s and Su-30s, plus British BAE Hawk 100 and 200 series aircraft. Indonesia also ordered 42 French Rafales for US$8.1 billion in 2022, with the first six due for delivery next year.\\nIn addition, Jakarta has signed a contract to buy 48 Kaan fighter jets from Turkey and is scheduled to receive two new T-50i fighter jets from South Korea in November as part of a procurement deal for six T-50i Golden Eagle jets.\\nBut, for now, it has just 62 operational fighters in its ranks. Spare parts for Russian-made Sukhoi Su-27s and Su-30s have become scarce and US-made F-16s are showing their age, according to the Australian Strategic Policy Institute (ASPI), a Canberra-based think tank.\\nASPI said the J-10 piqued Indonesian officials’ interest after Pakistan’s J-10s reportedly outperformed India’s French-made Rafale fighter jets during a clash in May.\\nHowever, Muhammad Fauzan Malufti, an Indonesian defence analyst, said Indonesian officials had not cited the India-Pakistan air skirmish as a factor. “Even if it played a role, I don’t think it is the main factor behind the decision,” Malufti said.\\nMalufti said the possible J-10 procurement served as a “political signal of neutrality and non-alignment” from Indonesia.\\n\\n\\nIan Storey, a senior fellow at the Singapore-based ISEAS-Yusof Ishak Institute, said price was a major consideration for the Indonesian military.\\n“Cost is one important factor, as the J-10 is less than half the price of its Western analogues, America’s F-16 and France’s Rafale,” Storey said, adding that Indonesia “does not want to depend” on any single country for its military equipment.\\nDuring the 1990s, the administration of then US president Bill Clinton imposed sanctions on Indonesia’s armed forces, citing human rights abuses in East Timor. As a result, the Indonesian Air Force’s American-made planes were grounded for lack of spare parts.\\nIn addition, the Prabowo administration has sought to “pursue a balanced foreign policy between East and West”, Storey said.\\nBuying the Chinese jets would reflect that policy and increase the number of countries from whom Indonesia sourced aircraft, but it would also complicate interoperability within its existing fleet and during military exercises with other countries.\\nStorey said it would be “a very challenging task for the Indonesian Air Force to integrate the encrypted communication, sensor networks and datalinks of Western, Russian and Chinese aircraft”.\\n“The air force will have to maintain separate and costly training, maintenance and logistical streams for all these different warplanes,” he added.\\nStorey also said the J-10’s electronic, sensor and communication systems were incompatible with Western-made aircraft. He said Indonesia would try to integrate the different systems but achieving full interoperability would be technically complex and very expensive.\\n“At best, Indonesia may only achieve partial interoperability, and that will be suboptimal in combat situations,” Storey said.\\n\\nMalufti agreed, saying the various aircraft from different countries would mean different spare parts, software, manuals, weapons, training and supply chains.\\n“[This would] force the Indonesian Air Force to buy unique tools, weapons and spare parts as well as create different training programmes for each aircraft, resulting in higher maintenance and training costs,” he said.\\nThe addition of Chinese fighter jets to Indonesia’s fleet would carry implications for its joint military exercises with Western countries.\\nStorey said the US “won’t allow its own fighter jets to exercise with Indonesia’s Russian-made and Chinese-made aircraft”.\\nThis prospect could complicate Indonesia’s flagship joint military exercise, Super Garuda Shield, held annually since 2007 in collaboration with the US and 11 other countries including Singapore, Germany, Australia, France and Britain.\\nThis year’s exercise involved more than 6,000 troops and was designed to boost interoperability and strengthen collective readiness among the participating armed forces.\\nFor China, a J-10 sale would mark a breakthrough in its defence diplomacy in Southeast Asia. Indonesia would become the first Association of Southeast Asian Nations member state to acquire a wholly Chinese-made modern, multirole fighter jet, according to Storey. At present, Myanmar operates JF-17s – fighter jets jointly developed by China and Pakistan – and the Chinese FTC-2000, a light training jet.\\nBut even if Indonesia did invest in the Chinese military hardware, “very few other regional states are likely to follow suit”, Storey said.\\nHe said Vietnam, the Philippines and Malaysia would be holdouts “because they are rival claimants with China in the South China Sea”. Singapore would “stick with US-made fighters” and Thailand was “unlikely to buy Chinese fighter jets either, preferring Western aircraft”.\\n“Myanmar might, if China is prepared to extend a generous loan,” Storey said.\\nIf it went ahead, it would “mark a significant milestone in Jakarta-Beijing defence cooperation”, Malufti said. “China would definitely use the deal to showcase the J-10 as a credible alternative to Western fighters.”\\n",

            "title": "Developer China Vanke reports US$2.3 billion loss amid sales slowdown",
            "description": "Developer China Vanke reported a deeper third-quarter loss, highlighting mounting challenges as the prolonged property market downturn continues to weigh on its sales.\\nThe Shenzhen-based company posted a loss of 16.1 billion yuan (US$2.3 billion) in the three months ended September 30, roughly doubling its loss from a year earlier. That brings its combined losses for the first nine months of the year to 28 billion yuan, according to a statement to the Shenzhen exchange on Thursday.\\nPersistent weakness in China’s housing market is creating pressure on the developer’s bottom line, despite increased financial support from its largest state-owned shareholder, Shenzhen Metro Group. The company’s financial position remains vulnerable as it deals with a wall of onshore debt maturities.\\nThe country’s home sales deteriorated further in July, and new-home prices fell at an accelerated pace. The price slump is deterring homebuyers who are increasingly concerned about the viability of buying real estate as a store of wealth.\\nThe developer’s gross contracted sales will likely further decline over the next six to 12 months, Moody’s Ratings said in a note earlier this month.\\nVanke was once China’s largest developer but has become the latest flashpoint in the nation’s prolonged property crisis, underscoring the severity of the sector’s challenges.\\nThe country’s new home sales by area may decline about 15 per cent from their current level before the sector stabilises, Fitch Ratings analyst Lulu Shi said earlier this week.\\nThe builder still has 10.8 billion yuan of onshore debt maturing by the end of this year. Its biggest maturity wall will be next year, when about 24 billion yuan of onshore public bonds and loans come due.\\n\\n“Vanke could face a more than 100 billion yuan drop in sales proceeds, which would worsen its funding gap and raise the costs of a government rescue,” Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Kristy Hung said in a note last week.\\nSeparately, Vanke said earlier in October that recently appointed Chairman Xin Jie resigned and that Huang Liping, general manager of Shenzhen Metro, would take over the role. Huang has served as a board member at Vanke since 2021.\\nInvestors grew concerned about future state support after the sudden resignation, leading to a mild decline in one of its dollar notes.\\nStill, Vanke said in the earnings release that Shenzhen Metro intended to provide another loan not exceeding 2.2 billion yuan. The funds are earmarked to help Vanke repay principal and interest on publicly issued bonds, the same purpose as the loans the shareholder provided earlier this year.\\nThe developer has secured sufficient funds to redeem a 2.5 billion yuan bond ahead of its maturity, Bloomberg News reported on Thursday, a move that may help soothe market worries.\\n",

            "description": "The family of a five-year-old boy who died in a school van in Malaysia’s Johor state has filed a negligence lawsuit against five parties, including the education ministry, seeking 2.08 million ringgit (US$495,831) in damages.\\nThe boy’s parents, Teo Jia Meng and Yu Yue Yang, named Tadika Perintis Indah, YK Educational Group, Double Tree Transport, van driver Yau Chee Weng and the ministry as defendants.\\nTheir lawyer, Ng Kian Nam, said the suit was filed over the defendants’ alleged negligence, which led to the death of Teo Yu Ze in the school van parked in front of a kindergarten in Taman Bukit Indah on April 30.\\n“The first three defendants failed to implement even the most basic and systematic safety protocols to ensure and safeguard the well-being of the child entrusted to their care by the plaintiffs.\\n“The first and second defendants also failed to check and confirm that the victim, who was transported by the van driver, had safely arrived at the kindergarten,” he told reporters outside the High Court building on Thursday after filing the suit.\\nNg said the defendants also failed to promptly tell and disclose to the plaintiffs the boy’s condition after discovering he had been left locked inside the van until he became unconscious.\\n“The fourth defendant [the van driver] failed to inspect the van after dropping off the other children, even though the vehicle was small.\\n“The defendant also failed to report and coordinate with the kindergarten to verify the number of children being transported that day,” he said.\\n\\nNg said the ministry also failed to take immediate and firm action against the first and second defendants following the incident.\\n“This includes carrying out investigations, suspending operational licences and pursuing criminal charges to protect the interests and safety of other pupils.\\n“The couple’s claim is based on the loss of their only child, who endured severe trauma and suffering before his death.\\n“The plaintiffs are seeking 59,301 ringgit in special damages and 2.03 million ringgit in general damages,” he added.\\nNg said the civil court action was filed to also send a strong message to all relevant stakeholders, including school operators, that safety must be prioritised, especially at the kindergarten level.\\nIt was reported that the boy was found unconscious in a school van outside a kindergarten in Taman Bukit Indah on April 30.\\nOn May 7, van driver Yau, 56, pleaded not guilty to a charge under Section 31(1)(a) of the Child Act 2001 of neglect or omission to care for a child in a manner likely to cause physical injury.\\nThis story was first published by The Star\\n",

            "title": "How Hong Kong can capitalise on Trump’s attacks on US universities",
            "description": "Few moments in US history have tested academic freedom as much as the present, with US President Donald Trump’s administration releasing a 10-point Compact for Academic Excellence in Higher Education. What started as bureaucratic proposals have hardened into a national doctrine tying federal funding to political conformity. It is changing the nature of US universities and reshaping international education options.\\nThe plan, initially sent to nine universities, proposed conformity with certain demands in return for securing preferential access to federal funds. They include removing race and gender factors from admissions and hiring, publishing detailed student applicant data, reinstating standardised testing, freezing tuition fees for five years and limiting the international undergraduate enrolment to 15 per cent.\\nUniversities with endowments exceeding US$2 million per student must offer free tuition for science degrees. Diversity and inclusion programmes are to be replaced by a “marketplace of ideas”. Institutions that sign the compact gain better access to federal research funding; those that refuse risk investigation or frozen grants.\\nThe backlash has been considerable. Most universities approached, including Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Brown, have rejected the agreement, viewing it as an attack on academic independence.\\nPublic opinion reflects these concerns. A recent poll by Quinnipiac University showed most Americans view the plan as government overreach. While some support measures to reduce costs in higher education, many feel uncomfortable with Washington’s growing control over campus affairs. This discomfort has sparked widespread opposition and protests across the country. Although higher education needs reform, many believe political enforcement is the wrong method.\\nFor international students, the plan comes amid a wave of restrictions. The Department of Homeland Security wants to replace the flexible “duration of status” visa rule with fixed terms of no more than four years, requiring renewals for longer courses. Applicants now face extended background and social media checks, new fees and mandatory reporting by universities. Visa caps targeting certain nationalities, especially Chinese students in science and technology fields, have fuelled uncertainty.\\n\\n\\nThis uncertainty is especially evident in India, where generations of students have aspired to study in the United States. That ambition is being disrupted, with a reported 45 per cent decline in Indian student arrivals. Academic pathways that once represented opportunity are now fraught with bureaucratic barriers, undermining the essence of US higher education and its ability to attract global talent, reducing its influence on the world stage.\\nMeanwhile other places are relaxing their admission policies. Hong Kong raised the limit on non-local undergraduates in publicly funded programmes to 40 per cent in 2024, and this year’s policy address proposes raising it to 50 per cent next year, signalling the city’s ambition. Universities are working to expand scholarships, research collaborations and partnerships. They offer a blend of East-West access and academic independence that appeals to students and academics seeking opportunity and openness.\\nBut challenges remain. While Hong Kong’s policies are evolving to attract international students, their integration into local communities and university life still lags behind. Many mainland and non-local students struggle to form meaningful connections with local peers.\\nUniversities need to go beyond academic achievement and foster the soft skills that enrich students’ experiences and prepare them to succeed in a multicultural world. These skills are vital not only for academic or professional success but also to promote cultural exchange and build genuine connections.\\nBuilding these connections is crucial for fostering mutual understanding, respect and a sense of community. As a student in the US, I formed lifelong friendships with peers from around the world, gained deep cultural insights and learned to navigate differences – experiences that enriched my education.\\n\\nFor Hong Kong to become a global education hub, it must cultivate integration, welcoming students from all parts of the world and creating connections that inspire collaboration and innovation.\\nThis is not new for Hong Kong. In the 1960s and 1970s, many Southeast Asian youth of Chinese descent came here for education because their parents wanted them to learn Chinese and options at home were limited. When these students returned home, they became valuable business connections, carrying fond memories of Hong Kong’s people, food and culture. Trust, built through shared experience, laid the groundwork for future business.\\nThis highlights the importance of Hong Kong leveraging its role as an international education hub to cultivate lasting connections. International students, including from the mainland, should leave with more than an education; they should carry meaningful relationships with local and international peers. Relationships formed at university can foster trust, collaboration and long-term success.\\n",

            "title": "Singapore’s Megan Khung tragedy: is it just about system lapses?",
            "description": "When John’s* parents divorced four years ago, his father turned violent.\\n“He became an alcoholic, there was a lot of verbal and emotional abuse, and he would lock me out of the house,” said John, now in his 20s, who still lives with his father. “Last April, he broke into my room and beat me with a screwdriver. He tried to hurt me, and he did.”\\nJohn reported the case to the police, who asked if he had another place to stay the night. Earlier this year, he applied for a personal protection order against his father, and the abuse has since waned.\\nJohn recalled that at the height of the violence, he had trouble understanding “why I was the one who was supposed to help myself escape the situation”.\\nSingapore’s child-protection system has been thrust into the spotlight following the horrific case of four-year-old Megan Khung, who was abused and beaten to death by her mother, Foo Li Ping, and the woman’s then boyfriend, Wong Shi Xiang.\\nMegan had suffered a year of abuse – including being forced to sleep in a planter box and getting hit by a water hosepipe – before she died in February 2020 after Wong dealt a fatal punch to her stomach. Wong and Foo burned Megan’s body in a metal barrel, and her death was only discovered five months later, following police reports lodged by her biological father and maternal grandmother.\\nIn April, Wong was sentenced to 30 years’ jail and 17 strokes of the cane, while Foo was sentenced to 19 years in jail.\\n\\nThe government set up an independent review panel to look into the case, and the report, released earlier this month, identified multiple lapses by several agencies. Breaches included the mischaracterisation of Megan’s injuries by social workers, as well as the failure of police officers and child protection specialists to follow up on the case.\\nAfter the findings, a police investigative officer resigned, and her supervisor was fined. In a rare move, Minister for Social and Family Development Masagos Zulkifli apologised and said the agencies could have done more.\\nIn a social media post to announce that the agencies had fully accepted the review panel’s findings on October 23, Masagos said: “We will reflect on the findings and take concrete steps to improve our support for vulnerable children ... Our resolve is absolute: We will do everything possible to prevent such tragedies from happening again.”\\nJohn, who said Megan’s death broke his heart when he read about it, told This Week in Asia: “I’m glad that I got to stand up for myself, but for a child like Megan, she’s not capable of doing what I did.\\n“I think those in the system need to have a bit more initiative and maybe more experience and speak out for those who don’t have a voice.”\\n\\nDid norms play a part?\\nMegan’s case has sparked reflection on whether cultural norms contributed to the tragedy, even as systemic lapses were spotlighted in the review report.\\nProfessionals told This Week in Asia that societal acceptance of physical discipline and the inclination to give in to authority might have contributed to the lapses.\\n“In many Asian societies, physical discipline is still perceived as an expression of parental care or authority,” said Lee Jungup, associate professor of social work at the National University of Singapore (NUS). “This can make early signs of abuse less visible to both families and professionals.”\\nThe cultural perception might also lead to a misclassification of abuse as discipline, said Mu Zheng, assistant professor at the sociology and anthropology department at NUS.\\nIn a report submitted to a regulatory authority in April 2019, Beyond Social Services, the social work agency that ran Megan’s preschool, characterised her bruises as a result of “physical punishment [that] was excessive”. The regulatory authority did not follow up with the case after the school principal confirmed that Megan was well and attending school regularly.\\nDaniel Lopez, an executive committee member at NGO Society Against Family Violence, said the relevant social worker’s description of the abuse as punishment might have affected authorities’ follow-up action. “Framing it as a punishment might have lessened the threat, because it seems interlinked with family values.”\\nIn September 2019, Beyond Social Services called the Child Protection Service, a government division that investigates child abuse cases, on two occasions and brought up Foo and Wong’s suspected drug use, as well as Megan’s unknown whereabouts.\\n\\nChild Protection Service recorded only one call, where it advised that Megan’s grandmother make a police report over the missing child.\\n“I think Beyond Social Services did the best they could,” Lopez said. “They highlighted that she couldn’t be sighted – this means they did try to locate her, which is the most that a community agency can do.”\\nLopez noted that not all stakeholders in the child protection system had equal authority.\\nA younger worker who challenges the decision of higher-ups may be perceived as disrespectful, according to Lopez, who has experience in social work. “There is a bit of a culture of fear or apprehension in questioning the judgment of people above us.”\\nTo name and shame?\\nIn the wake of Megan’s case, more child abuse cases have been reported in recent months.\\nTeo Guan Huat, 61, who worked as a preschool cook, pleaded guilty in court to sexually assaulting three girls, aged one to two, earlier this month. He said he molested the children as they were too young to speak, and there would be a smaller chance of him being caught, according to local media. The gag order on Teo’s identity was lifted after the prosecutor clarified in court that keeping the names of the children and school undisclosed was sufficient to protect the identity of the victims.\\nIn a related case, four women, who worked at the same preschool, were charged in February with covering up Teo’s sexual assault on the premises. They had allegedly deleted footage of Teo molesting a toddler in 2023. The women in this pending case have not been identified.\\nThe lack of identification of responsible parties has sparked debate on whether naming offenders would serve the public interest and boost deterrence.\\n\\nEven in the absence of a gag order, Singapore’s law prohibits the publication of information relating to court proceedings that could lead to the identification of any child or young person, such as the name, address and school of a victim.\\nLawyer Amarjit Singh told This Week in Asia that one downside of anonymity meant that culprits were spared from public accountability, and this could discourage other victims from coming forward.\\nBut the fear of being identified might also discourage victims from testifying, said Benjamin Ong, an assistant law professor at Singapore Management University. “Unfortunately, society tends to attach shame and stigma to being a victim of certain offences, such as sexual offences,” he added.\\nOng said there should not be a blanket rule on the types of information covered by a gag order. He noted that while naming schools could lead to the identification of a victim, it might also pose little to no risk in some cases and be beneficial to the public interest.\\nHe suggested that the law be changed to allow victims to request the lifting of a gag order, and for the court to weigh various factors – such as public interest and whether the victim fully understood the consequences – before deciding to accept the request.\\nThe option to lift the anonymity should remain for life, Ong added.\\nWhen you legislate, accountability is enshrined\\nCindy Tay, Children’s Aid Society’s director of home\\n“There are cases where people were sexually abused when they were children and were initially anonymous, but then they had the gag orders lifted after they became adults. It may have been many years after the incident, but it was still part of telling their story.”\\nCindy Tay, director of home at Children’s Aid Society, said when considering lifting a gag order, one must always prioritise the victim’s well-being. “Any exposure that compromises their physical or psychological safety would be deeply concerning,” she said.\\nIdentification is not the only way to hold stakeholders accountable, and the establishment of an independent review panel should be considered for all fatality and near-fatality cases involving young victims of abuse, according to Tay.\\nThe panel should not only identify lapses and provide recommendations to improve the system, but also monitor follow-up actions and compliance with its recommendations, she added.\\n“When you legislate, accountability is enshrined,” she said. “Given the tragic outcomes in these cases, this is the right step to safeguard children and strengthen the system.”\\n*Name changed to protect identity\\n",

            "description": "Brunei has officially adopted China’s civil aviation certification standards, easing access for Chinese-built aircraft such as the narrowbody C919 jet into the wealthy Southeast Asian market while serving as a potential model for how the planes could expand their international reach.\\nBrunei accepted the airworthiness code of the Civil Aviation Administration of China earlier this month, the Chinese embassy in Brunei said on Monday on its website, citing the equatorial country’s Department of Civil Aviation.\\nPreviously, Brunei had recognised only aircraft certificates issued by the European Aviation Safety Agency, the US Federal Aviation Administration and Transport Canada Civil Aviation, the embassy said.\\n“Through this revision, Brunei becomes another country to explicitly recognise China’s standards on large aircraft,” the embassy said.\\nThe Commercial Aircraft Corporation of China (Comac) is trying to expand its market for the C919 – China’s first domestically made narrowbody aircraft – overseas and challenge the duopoly of Airbus and Boeing. Comac has already secured orders for hundreds of C919 units from Chinese airlines.\\nBrunei’s adoption of the Chinese standards follows a US$2 billion order by start-up carrier GallopAir in 2023 for 30 Comac aircraft, including the smaller C909 regional jet formerly known as the ARJ21.\\nOn its website, the Brunei-based airline called the order Comac’s largest international sale, and likely the first overseas C919 purchase. The airline has a seven-year plan to connect four countries in Southeast Asia with China.\\nTony Fernandes, CEO of Malaysian carrier AirAsia, also said the airline was in “active discussions” to place an order with Comac during the Belt and Road Summit in Hong Kong last month.\\nIt’s quite ingrained – the use of Western aircraft … The supply chains have been built around Western aircraft\\nIbrahim Suffian, Merdeka Centre\\nBrunei’s recognition of the Chinese airworthiness codes marks one step in a longer approval process for Comac planes, said YK Leung, managing director of Hong Kong-based Linken Capital Aviation Services. He said the C919 would need separate “validation” from Brunei to operate there.\\nBrunei, despite its wealth from oil and gas, has a population of just 462,000 and no domestic flights, only international routes. This means that the C919 would need not only validation from Brunei, but also air-service agreements from the destination countries, Leung said.\\nAgreements related to scheduled and charter flights depend partly on the airworthiness of an aircraft type, he said.\\nWhile Leung said he did not think getting air-service agreements around Southeast Asia would be difficult, he added other countries must determine whether evaluating the planes is worth the time and cost.\\n“Brunei is a small user, so it will take a while,” said Ibrahim Suffian, programme director with the Merdeka Centre polling group in Malaysia. Comac would need to train local engineers and maintenance staff to supplement the many who already service Airbus and Boeing jets, he said.\\nBased on its specifications, the C919 is most directly comparable to the Airbus A320 and Boeing 737 families of aircraft and largely matches those airliners on maximum flight distances and passenger loads.\\nBut the competition will be stiff, Suffian said.\\n“It’s quite ingrained – the use of Western aircraft. It’s just tradition. The supply chains have been built around Western aircraft.”\\n",

We have been living in a rental property for three years and simply cannot afford to buy a flat. We are drowning in debt and desperately want to win.”\\n\\n“We did not know how to surprise you, Mellstroy, so we decided to tattoo our one-year-old child,” she added.\\nThe child cried throughout the entire process.\\n\\nThe video triggered public outrage, with netizens condemning their cruelty and demanding a police investigation.\\nAs the backlash intensified, the couple admitted the next day that the act had been staged.\\n\\nAccording to Izvestia, a daily broadsheet newspaper in Russia, the mother clarified that the “tattoo” had actually been drawn with a pen.\\n“We did not tattoo the child.

            "title": "US senators call on Trump to raise Jimmy Lai concerns with Xi in key meeting",
            "description": "A bipartisan group of 38 US senators is urging President Donald Trump to use his expected summit with Chinese President Xi Jinping in South Korea next week to secure the release of former Hong Kong media mogul Jimmy Lai Chee-ying, the latest in the US Congress’s efforts to get human rights on the agenda of the high-stakes meeting.\\nIn a letter released on Friday, the lawmakers described Lai as a political prisoner and said the case for his release was “more dire than ever” due to his worsening health.\\n“At 78 years old, he is in poor and deteriorating health. He is a diabetic and suffers from numerous physical ailments that are compounded by his continuing incarceration,” they wrote.\\n“Mr Lai’s representatives have assured us that if he is released, he will leave Hong Kong and never return. He would have no desire to remain in public life. Should he die in prison, on the other hand, he would become a martyr; a powerful and enduring symbol of opposition.”\\nThe letter sent to Trump, dated October 23, was led by two Republicans, Rick Scott of Florida, and James Risch, the chair of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.\\nLai is currently awaiting a verdict after a marathon national security trial in Hong Kong that concluded earlier this year.\\n\\nThe businessman-turned-opposition activist, who founded the now-defunct Apple Daily tabloid, is the most prominent figure yet to be prosecuted under the Beijing-decreed national security law.\\nUS and other Western politicians have repeatedly condemned his prosecution as an attack on press freedom and demanded his release.\\nHong Kong authorities have dismissed such accusations as attempts to undermine the city’s rule of law.\\nResponding to the letter on Friday, the Chinese embassy in Washington reiterated this.\\n“Hong Kong upholds the rule of law. To abide by the law and bring lawbreakers to justice is a basic principle,” said spokesperson Liu Pengyu.\\n“Jimmy Lai is the principal mastermind and perpetrator behind the series of riots that shook Hong Kong. He is an agent and henchman of those hostile to China.”\\nTrump earlier this year said he would seek to do what he could to “save” Lai, echoing a pledge from the presidential campaign trail last year.\\nThe US president is expected to meet Xi on the sidelines of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (Apec) summit in South Korea next Thursday local time, as part of a stabilising effort after a recent escalation in tensions.\\n\\n\\nRelations between the US and China hit new lows in recent weeks, after Beijing announced on October 9 that it would roll out further export restrictions on rare earth elements, key raw materials used in hi-tech manufacturing, in what many saw as a response to the expansion of a US trade blacklist.\\nTrump responded to Beijing’s announcement by threatening to impose an additional 100 per cent tariffs on Chinese goods – which he later conceded was “not sustainable” – and introduce export controls on all “critical software”.\\nMore complications arose when two countries began implementing new port fee structures on each other’s ships, and Trump warned he was considering a halt to purchases of Chinese cooking oil.\\nPressure on China ahead of major events has sometimes yielded results. In 2000, post-arrest publicity helped to release Dickinson College librarian Song Yongyi, then a US permanent resident, when Beijing needed US Congressional approval to join the World Trade Organisation.\\nAlso this week, a similar letter was sent to the US president by a group of Republican lawmakers asking him to press Xi for the release of Americans imprisoned or under exit bans in China.\\nTrump said earlier this week that he was seeking a deal with Xi on “everything”.\\n",

            "title": "Hong Kong has set course to join the ‘yacht club of Asia’, can it find way?",
            "description": "On a recent weekend, the members-only Lantau Yacht Club in Hong Kong hosted a high-profile boat show, with Rolls-Royce limousines, luxury Jacob &amp; Co timepieces, drones and live music all part of the package to tempt well-heeled guests.\\nThe privately owned yacht club, in Lantau’s Island’s resort-like Discovery Bay neighbourhood, was a pioneer in reconfiguring operations to target high-end superyachts in 2020 and has 148 wet berths and associated facilities.\\nFranklin Mak, executive vice-president of hospitality at HKR International, the developer behind the club, estimated that one large visiting yacht could generate a daily six-figure sum in economic activity through spending by guests and crew on shore.\\n“Actually, for one [large] boat, there is an average of tens of thousands of dollars, over HK$100,000, in business effect per day,” Mak said. “The numbers are impressive.”\\nIt is not just private operators that are eyeing the financial benefits of the yacht economy – potentially worth billions of dollars annually – the government is also aiming to go full steam ahead with an ambitious plan to catapult Hong Kong into the “yacht club of Asia”.\\nBut challenges remain in public access, facilities, skilled workforce shortages and bureaucratic coordination. With industry players calling for a fundamental policy shift to fully unlock Hong Kong’s yacht tourism potential and create a seamless experience that rivals established Asian hubs, how can the city set a course for success?\\nCity leader John Lee Ka-chiu made waves recently by unveiling some yacht tourism measures during his latest policy blueprint to capitalise on Hong Kong’s natural assets of 1,180km (733.2 miles) of coastline and 263 islands.\\nThe Post has learned that more initiatives are on the way to fast track development following the government’s plan to create 1,100 berths, including 500 at the airport that can accommodate 80-metre superyachts.\\nIn his annual policy address last month, the chief executive pledged to ease the requirements for visiting yachts, allowing them to anchor in designated government waters, and to mandate mainland Chinese organisations to conduct exams for local yacht masters to help visiting crew and captains obtain qualifications for sailing in Hong Kong.\\nThe measures aim to allow cross-border yachting in what Lee called an “individual travel scheme” for yachts, both northbound or southbound. These measures would ultimately be extended to visiting yachts from overseas, Lee promised.\\nTransport minister Mable Chan recently underlined the importance of the initiative: “I do agree that the yacht economy will bring a lot of economic benefits to Hong Kong. We have rich marine resources. We have a magnificent base in Hong Kong. The current-term government is goal-oriented. Different policy bureaus will work together for synergy.”\\n\\nHow big is the market?\\nThe Business and Professionals Alliance for Hong Kong (BPA), a political party, estimated in a recent report that a successful yacht industry could inject HK$4.5 billion into the city’s economy annually – HK$3 billion from services such as maintenance, berthing and chartering, and HK$1.5 billion from boat sales.\\nThe city already boasts a large local fleet, with around 12,000 Class IV vessels – or pleasure boats – registered as of the end of October 2024, with the number having grown steadily by about 300 per year.\\nAccording to a government reply to a lawmaker’s question last November, 58 non-locally registered vessels visited Hong Kong for leisure last year as of October, 27.5 per cent lower than in 2023. The number of overseas vessels and passengers visiting the city between 2021 and 2023 grew continuously, the statistics showed.\\nThe Royal Hong Kong Yacht Club pointed to intense pressure on facilities in the city, adding that mooring capacity was “entirely saturated, with waiting lists demonstrating years of pent-up local demand”.\\nIt also highlighted the massive economic potential being missed, estimating that a fully developed sector could contribute “hundreds of millions of dollars annually to the local economy”.\\nA thriving yacht sector also creates a “halo effect”, driving demand in adjacent luxury industries such as high-end retail, hospitality, wellness and fine dining, and catering to an affluent clientele seeking exclusive experiences, according to trend forecasting firm WGSN.\\nHong Kong’s US$27 billion wellness economy provides fertile ground for positioning yachting within this lucrative market.\\nOlivier Besson, founder and chief executive of yacht dealer and brokerage firm Asia Yachting, said the primary economic potential spanned the entire ownership cycle.\\n“The real value of the ‘yacht economy’ lies not only in new yacht sales but across the entire ownership cycle – berthing, operations, aftersales and management,” Besson said.\\nOther components of the industry chain include insurance, legal and professional services, repair and maintenance, and the hospitality sector.\\nFor example, a visiting yacht is required to possess a valid third-party risks insurance policy of not less than HK$5 million coverage for operating a vessel within Hong Kong waters. Third-party risks and other yacht-related insurance products that comply with the law are available in the market.\\n\\nPlain sailing elsewhere?\\nSome industry leaders and sailors said the policy address laid down the groundwork, but more had to be done to materialise its ambitions. A lack of public access and facilities had created a polarised market, they said.\\nCanadian-Hong Kong writer and yachtsman Cameron Dueck, 51, described the local scene as “very club-based”, limiting its appeal compared with places such as Japan with well-run public marinas.\\nDueck, who left the city in October 2023 and has since sailed extensively in Taiwan, Japan and South Korea on his 42-foot yacht, contrasted Hong Kong’s exclusivity with the accessibility he found elsewhere.\\n“We’re in Japan at the moment, and it has a great network of marinas, some of which are club based, but many are run as public facilities,” Dueck said.\\n“They are not as fancy or prestigious as a private club may be, but they’re simple, well-run facilities that make boating more accessible to the general public.”\\nHe said Japan had also taken the innovative step of opening its fishing ports to yachts for short stays, a move that “greatly enhanced its appeal as a cruising destination”.\\nThis pragmatic approach, Dueck said, offered a model Hong Kong could emulate by better utilising its existing typhoon shelters, rather than focusing solely on building new high-end facilities.\\nFor yacht owners such as himself, the costs and hassles in Hong Kong were significant, he said.\\nDueck said a rule of thumb was that annual maintenance costs were roughly 10 per cent of a yacht’s value, on top of Hong Kong’s high mooring fees.\\nTo ensure they have supporting facilities, most yacht owners are attached to private clubs such as the Royal Hong Kong Yacht Club, the Aberdeen Marina Club, the Aberdeen Boat Club, the Gold Coast Yacht and Country Club and others.\\nJack Wong, chairman of the Clearwater Bay Golf and Country Club, pointed to the economic benefit of sports development, noting his club supported “competitive sailing by hosting prestigious international regattas”.\\nHe said these events, like a recent championship for more than 200 junior sailors, generated “considerable spending on accommodation, dining, transport and leisure”, positively affecting the local tourism sector.\\nWhile the government plans new berths, industry leaders consistently pointed to a dearth of convenient landing spots, reliable water and power supplies, and proper waste disposal facilities as the critical “missing link” preventing growth.\\nLawrence Chow, chairman of the Hong Kong Boating Industry Association, said that five newly proposed free-anchorage zones – including in Stanley Bay and Tai Tam Bay – were a great start and initiative. But they would be of limited use without basic amenities like floating pontoons nearby.\\n“Visitors still need a way to get off their boat to go ashore,” Chow said, adding that without nearby landing points, the new anchorage zones would be very difficult for visitors to use”.\\nHe suggested that the immediate priority should be “developing pontoons at various locations to allow people with yachts and dinghies to temporarily berth alongside and go ashore”.\\nIf visiting vessels must return to the same anchorage points when cruising, then there should be more designated anchorage points; otherwise, cruising for visiting yachts would still be quite restrictive, Chow added.\\nBill Lau, founder of yacht services platform Holimood, pointed to poor user experience at many public piers compared with private yacht clubs, noting issues with safety, accessibility and a lack of facilities including power on shore.\\n\\nHe contrasted this with Sanya on Hainan Island and Phuket in Thailand, where dedicated tourist centres and proper infrastructure supported the yacht charter industry.\\n“[Tourists] gather at a visitor centre to board, perhaps with [food and drinks], watersports equipment and other add-on services – the whole experience is very different,” Lau said.\\nBut in Hong Kong, “waiting to board at Central or Tsim Sha Tsui piers in the hot weather – you can see during peak hours you might wait for an hour because too many boats are coming and going”, he said.\\n“How can the experience be good in the heat? But these basic things haven’t been done – that’s the infrastructure side.”\\nHe argued that Hong Kong’s real, immediate potential lay in packaging its existing charter fleet and accessible cruising grounds into attractive short-term tourism products, a segment currently underdeveloped and poorly marketed.\\nNew blood needed\\nMultiple industry insiders, including Mak, Besson and Andrew Chan, director of sales and marketing from parts supplier Ronsil Development, highlighted a severe shortage of skilled marine engineers and technicians, especially certified marine electricians, compounded by an ageing workforce.\\n“Current mechanics may not have enough or updated knowledge to catch up with the new technology and requirement,” said Chan, who is also deputy chairman of the Hong Kong Boating Industry Association, adding that specialised knowledge was required for marine systems and modern electronic engines.\\nSimon Chan, boss of brokerage Wah Hing (China) Marine, put it bluntly: “Which mother would let her son go and work on boats?” Even those without academic qualifications preferred not to do such hard work, he added.\\nBesson said this deficit in maintenance, repair and overhaul services directly affected Hong Kong’s superyacht ambitions.\\nWhile the Marine Department said local shipyards could service vessels over 100 metres, industry players disagreed on the quality and availability.\\nMak noted long waiting lists for repairs, sometimes up to three months.\\n\\nChan said many Hong Kong superyachts were sailed to the Philippines or Thailand for major work.\\nHe said Zhuhai’s Jinwan district, with its lower costs and growing shipyard capacity, was poised to capture the lucrative market as cross-border travel eases.\\nHoward Chen, chief executive of Zhuhai-based Selene Yachts, said Jinwan aimed to offer world-class maintenance, repairs and overhaul services at labour costs less than half of Hong Kong’s.\\n“In terms of speed, one side [Hong Kong] needs three or four months; over here [in Jinwan], we can fix it in three or four days, three or four weeks,” Chen said. “In terms of price, wages are cheaper by half … you save at least 30 per cent or more.”\\nWhile a Hong Kong government task force is working with Guangdong counterparts to ease cross-border procedures for yachts, the reality remains difficult.\\nWilson Lam, sales manager of Wah Hing (China) Marine, said the application process for taking a boat across the border could take one to two months, compared with days for vehicle permits, killing any spontaneity.\\nAt present, visiting pleasure vessels including those from the mainland entering Hong Kong waters are required to complete port formalities with the Marine Department, the Immigration Department, the Department of Health and the Customs and Excise Department.\\nIf a vessel intends to cruise into Hong Kong waters for leisure purposes, conduct repairs, participate in a racing event or change its berthing location, it must file an application to the Marine Office for permission.\\n\\nDueck said true cruising freedom required the ability to explore multiple ports after a single entry clearance, which was currently impossible in the Greater Bay Area.\\n“Currently, it is too much hassle for most individual Hong Kong yachts to even sail to Macau for the weekend, unless they are taking part in an organised event,” Dueck said.\\nResolving these interconnected challenges required a fundamental shift in governance and specific policy reforms, critics and industry players said.\\nPaul Zimmerman, honorary president of the association and an urban planning advocate, said a single government body with the budget, authority and mandate to manage the entire marine recreation ecosystem was needed, breaking the current fragmented approach where responsibility was split ineffectively between the Marine Department, the Leisure and Cultural Services Department, the Development Bureau and others.\\nBPA legislator Benson Luk Hon-man, an advocate for the yacht industry, urged the government to establish a high-level task force, potentially led by a deputy secretary in the government, to cut across bureaucratic silos and drive the multifaceted initiative forward.\\n“The yacht economy encompasses multiple policy areas, so the government needs to consider coordination comprehensively,” Luk said.\\n“To this end, I propose establishing a high-level task force led by deputy secretaries of departments to coordinate and drive the relevant policy bureaus, accelerating the implementation of measures to develop the yacht economy.”\\nSuch a body, proponents argued, was essential given the policy spanned the remits of transport, tourism, development, marine and immigration authorities.\\nTangible changes were needed to make Hong Kong more competitive and user-friendly, industry players said.\\nA top priority, Besson said, was to align local regulations – covering yacht registration, licensing and navigation rights – with international standards. This was crucial to making it easier for foreign-flagged yachts to visit or base themselves in the city, he added.\\nFranklin Mak of the Lantau Yacht Club strongly advocated for streamlining immigration and customs procedures through digital systems, drawing parallels with Hong Kong’s efficient airport clearance, and suggested exploring licence reciprocity to simplify crew requirements.\\nThe Marine Department highlighted its planned upgrades to the electronic business system for one-stop clearance and the authorisation of mainland bodies to conduct local licence exams.\\nIndustry players said the scale of the task was immense, requiring coordination across borders and departments, significant investment in both hardware and software, and a long-term commitment to nurturing talent and protecting the environment.\\nParadoxically, the path to a high-end yacht economy could lie in providing support for growing the grass roots who enjoyed boating and watersports, Zimmerman argued.\\n“So if you want to attract the big boats, you should focus on the economy of the small boats … make sure that that economy works, so that you have a large group of people who know the water.”\\n",
