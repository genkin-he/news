            "description": "US Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth met Chinese Defence Minister Dong Jun in person for the first time on Friday, with both sides saying they are pushing for peace a day after a summit between their presidents brought tensions down.\\nThe discussion on the sidelines of the Asean Defence Ministers’ Meeting Plus in Malaysia was the first face-to-face meeting between the defence ministers of China and the US since Donald Trump’s return to the White House, although Dong and Hegseth had held a video call in September.\\nHegseth described his talks with Dong in Kuala Lumpur as “a good and constructive meeting” in a post on X on Friday.\\n\\n\\nHe said the US did not seek conflict, echoing statements he made during a video call with Dong in September.\\nDong said China was committed to peaceful development while resolutely safeguarding its national security interests, and had the full capability to calmly respond to any infringements or provocations, according to a statement from China’s defence ministry.\\n“We hope the US will implement its statements of not containing China and not seeking conflict with concrete actions,” Dong said.\\nHe said Chinese President Xi Jinping and his counterpart Trump’s successful meeting in South Korea provided strategic guidance for the stable development of China-US relations in their next stage, adding that the defence departments of both countries should take concrete actions to implement the consensus reached by the heads of state.\\nThe Xi-Trump meeting on Thursday was the first between them since Trump began his second term in January. Both sides appeared to show personal warmth and downplay the competitive aspect of the meeting while stating they had achieved some trade negotiation results and expressing an intention to visit each others’ countries.\\n“The two countries should strengthen decision-making level communication to increase trust and eliminate suspicion … and encourage universities, academia and the strategic community to provide support for the two militaries to explore the correct way of coexisting,” Dong said.\\nAnd Hegseth wrote on X: “We will continue discussions with the People’s Liberation Army on matters of mutual importance”.\\nThe issue of Taiwan, which has been included in almost all in-person meetings between Xi Jinping and his US counterparts in recent years, was surprisingly absent from public statements from Beijing and Washington about Thursday’s meeting.\\nHowever, the two defence chiefs brought up the issue on Friday. Dong said the US should be cautious in its words and actions on the Taiwan issue and must unequivocally oppose “Taiwan independence”.\\n“The reunification of the two sides of the Taiwan Strait is an unstoppable historical trend,” Dong added.\\nHegseth reiterated US concerns about China’s activities in the South China Sea and the Taiwan Strait and posted on X that he had met Philippine Defence Secretary Gilberto Teodoro Jnr on Friday.\\n“We will work relentlessly to reestablish deterrence in the South China Sea and advance our alliance,” he posted.\\nThe defence ministers’ statements appeared mild compared to talks between the nations’ defence ministers in May last year.\\nAt that time, Dong warned then US defence secretary Lloyd Austin about the US congratulating William Lai Ching-te on being elected Taiwan’s leader, saying it sent “a seriously wrong signal to the pro-independence separatist forces”.\\n\\n\\nAustin expressed concern at the time about the PLA’s activities in the Taiwan Strait, emphasising that China should not use Taiwan’s political transition as a pretext for coercive measures.\\nBeijing sees Taiwan as part of China to be reunited by force if necessary. Most countries, including the US, do not recognise Taiwan as an independent state, but Washington is opposed to any attempt to take the self-governed island by force and is committed to supplying it with weapons.\\nFriday’s meeting also came amid reports of an ongoing change to the US’ overall defence strategy. Reports suggest that the Pentagon’s new national defence strategy, which is still being developed, may prioritise the protection of the homeland and the western hemisphere, marking a departure from making competition with China and Russia a top priority.\\n",

            "title": "Philippines blocks resale of ex-lawmaker’s aircraft after jets traced to Singapore, Malaysia",
            "description": "A former Philippine lawmaker accused of masterminding a vast public works corruption scheme allegedly tried to move part of his fortune out of reach of investigators by flying his private aircraft abroad.\\nA Gulfstream jet and two helicopters linked to disgraced congressman Elizaldy “Zaldy” Co were sent to Singapore and Malaysia in recent months, just as authorities were preparing to freeze billions of pesos in suspected ill-gotten assets.\\nPhilippine aviation regulators say the aircraft cannot now be sold or re-registered overseas under international aviation law, even though they left the country before formal proceedings began.\\nThe discovery is the latest twist in an escalating corruption scandal that has gripped the Philippines, where Co – until recently the powerful head of the House appropriations committee – is accused of orchestrating fraudulent public works projects worth billions of pesos.\\nThe Civil Aviation Authority of the Philippines (CAAP) confirmed in a statement issued on Thursday “that three registered air assets connected to Mr. Co have departed from the country”.\\n“We are coordinating with the civil aviation authorities of the countries that these aircraft flew to and we are asking them to help monitor because that is all we can do for now,” CAAP Director General Raul del Rosario said at a press conference as quoted by GMA News.\\n\\nThe three aircraft are part of a fleet that includes at least 13 helicopters and fixed-wing planes registered to companies linked to Co. The fleet’s scale has drawn widespread outrage, particularly after comparisons showed Co’s private air assets outnumbered those of the Philippine Coast Guard.\\n“It is disheartening to see a legislator possessing numerous air assets,” coastguard spokesman Jay Tarriela said in late September, noting that the entire coastguard had just three planes and two helicopters.\\nPublic Works Secretary Vince Dizon said the fleet included a Gulfstream G350 executive jet valued at more than US$26 million, which was located in Singapore as early as August 16.\\nTwo AgustaWestland helicopters were flown to Kota Kinabalu, Malaysia, on August 20 and September 11. Co himself was not on board any of the flights, according to regulators.\\nThe remaining 10 aircraft are still in the Philippines and are under active monitoring by CAAP.\\nDespite some having left the country before Co’s assets were frozen, CAAP officials stressed that none of the aircraft can legally be sold or re-registered abroad. Under international aviation law, aircraft cannot be registered in a new jurisdiction unless they are first deregistered by the original country.\\nThe CAAP has issued a hold on the deregistration of all 13 aircraft, effectively freezing their resale value.\\n“You cannot sell it or transfer ownership unless it is deregistered in the Philippines,” Dizon said at a press briefing on September 30, as quoted by ABS-CBN.\\nAttempts by Co’s companies to deregister some of the aircraft in September were blocked by CAAP in coordination with the Anti-Money Laundering Council (AMLC) and the National Bureau of Investigation.\\n\\n\\nThe freeze on Co’s aviation assets is part of a broader multi-agency investigation into alleged systemic corruption in the Philippines’ flood-control infrastructure programme.\\nAs appropriations chair, Co allegedly inserted hundreds of billions of pesos into the public works budget for so-called flood-control projects. Investigators say many of these were substandard or fictitious, with funds funnelled to contractors who delivered kickbacks in cash-stuffed suitcases.\\nOn October 23, AMLC disclosed that it had frozen 5.2 billion pesos (US$89 million) in assets linked to Co and his associates. “We’re still waiting for the submission of other bank accounts and valuation of other properties,” AMLC Executive Director Matthew David said, as quoted by GMA News.\\nCo resigned from Congress on September 29, citing “grave and imminent threats” to his safety. In a statement reported by GMA News, he said: “All I can tell you now is that the accusations being made against me are false … I can only stay silent to protect my family and myself.”\\nHe had left the country in July for medical reasons, and his current whereabouts are unknown. The justice department has requested an Interpol “blue notice” to locate him.\\nThe wider corruption scandal – widely dubbed the “ghost flood-control” controversy – centres on hundreds of budget insertions allegedly made by lawmakers to fund infrastructure projects that were either non-existent or awarded to politically connected contractors.\\nMany of these projects were approved without proper documentation or on-site verification, allowing what investigators believe was a coordinated kickback scheme to flourish across multiple provinces.\\nPublic anger has intensified in recent weeks, fuelled by viral videos showing contractors and officials flaunting luxury cars, designer goods and overseas travel. In response, President Ferdinand Marcos Jnr has formed an independent commission to investigate what is likely to be one of the Philippines’ most consequential corruption cases in decades.\\n",

            "title": "A Great Wall, the first American film shot in China, told a genial East meets West tale",
            "description": "This is the latest instalment in a feature series reflecting on instances of East meets West in world cinema, including China-US co-productions.\\nIf asked to name the first American film to be shot and co-produced in China, most film buffs would likely say Bernardo Bertolucci’s 1987 Oscar winner The Last Emperor – and they would be wrong.\\nThe correct answer is Peter Wang Zhengfang’s modest 1986 comedy-drama A Great Wall, which was filmed in both countries and has since slipped from the public consciousness. This is a pity because, as a snapshot of two opposing cultures attempting to get along, it makes for rewarding viewing.\\nBorn in Beijing, Wang left for Taiwan in 1949, emigrating to the United States in the 1970s to pursue a PhD in electro-optics.\\n\\n\\nInstead, he went into film, acting in the 1982 indie Chan Is Missing, a key work of Asian-American cinema, and the 1983 film Ah Ying, a neo-realistic classic in the Hong Kong New Wave movement.\\nIn that same year, Wang also partnered with producer/co-writer Shirley Sun and the Chinese production company Nanhai to make his debut as a writer, director and star. The resulting work, A Great Wall, proved a genial tale of the misunderstandings that emerge when East meets West.\\nIn the film, middle-aged Chinese-American émigré Leo Fang (Wang) works for a computing company in San Francisco. When he is passed over for a promotion, he quits his job and takes his wife, Grace (Sharon Iwai), and son, Paul (Kelvin Han Yee), on holiday to Beijing, his hometown, for the summer.\\nUpon arrival, they stay with Leo’s sister, Mrs Chao (Shen Guanglan), her traditionalist husband (Hu Xiaoguang) and their teenage daughter, Lili (Li Qinqin).\\n\\nAs the families get to know each other, Paul finds himself competing for Lili’s affections with local boy Yida (Wang Xiao), soon to become his rival at the local table tennis club.\\nAt one point, we watch the teenagers playing American football on the Great Wall, but the title actually refers to the city’s Ming dynasty fortifications, which, Leo notes, were intended to keep the inhabitants in as much as invaders out.\\nAs a first-time writer-director, Wang drew heavily on his own background.\\n“This is not by choice,” he told journalist Randy Parker. “If I want to make independent films and write my own scripts, I have to base [them] on the experiences that I am familiar with. And I happen to be Chinese-American.”\\nAlthough there is a big disconnect between the Fangs and the Chaos, it is mostly explored with wry amusement. We see Leo limbering up for a jog, while Mr Chao practises tai chi. Grace and Mrs Chao swap fashion and make-up tips, and Paul queues to get on a packed bus, which drives off without him.\\n\\nMostly, we are left with the sense of two families – and two cultures – trying each other on for size. The best moments are the sweetest ones, such as Yida and his friend Yu (Xiu Jian) strutting about pretending to be American models.\\nBut there are occasional hints of darkness. Mrs Chao reads Lili’s letters – in China, we are told, there is no such thing as privacy – and Yida and Yu cannot afford to drink Coca-Cola because it costs half a day’s wages.\\nBoth Paul and Mr Chao have revealing – if offensive – outbursts. “The American society is corrupt,” says the usually jolly Mr Chao. “It’s full of crime and also sexually promiscuous. And the streets are full of homosexuals.”\\nPerhaps Paul hews closer to the film’s viewpoint when he tells Leo, “All Chinese parents are racists. You use the tradition and the culture to cover the racism.”\\n\\n\\nUltimately, though, this is a film about what connects people, rather than what divides them. After a low-stakes table tennis match, the Paul-Lili-Yida love triangle is resolved. Back home in America, Grace wears a Chinese garment made for her by Mrs Chao, while Leo practises tai chi.\\nIn China, meanwhile, Lili learns to stick up for herself, telling her mother, “Privacy is privacy, you can’t translate it!” and Yida earns a celebratory bottle of cola for passing his exams.\\nWang, it seems, was aiming for the subtle generational dramas of Yasujiro Ozu’s 1953 classic Tokyo Story – hence the Chinese title, which translates as Beijing Story. But the film’s spirit of gentle revolution might have stopped it from being widely shown in China.\\nIt was more warmly received in America, with critic Roger Ebert writing, “A Great Wall is about the sort of visit I imagine most of us would like to make, back to the people and the ways of life where we, or our ancestors, came from. We would likely discover what the Fangs discover, that you can’t go home again.”\\nThe same was true for Wang. After two more modest co-productions, he disappeared into obscurity.\\nWant more articles like this? Follow SCMP Film on Facebook\\n",

            "description": "Apple is struggling in China as sales decline amid cutthroat competition with domestic brands, but CEO Tim Cook says he is confident of a rebound on the back of rising demand for the iPhone 17 line-up.\\nThe US tech giant’s revenue in Greater China, which covers mainland China, Hong Kong and Taiwan, dropped 4 per cent year on year to US$14.5 billion in the three months ended September, the company reported on Thursday.\\nOn a conference call with analysts, Cook attributed China’s sales weakness to “supply constraints” during the quarter that affected the availability of some iPhone 16 and 17 models, despite strong demand.\\nHe expressed optimism that the China market would return to growth, citing the positive reception of the iPhone 17 series.\\n\\n“With [store] traffic being up significantly year on year and [because of] the reception of the [iPhone] 17 family, we expect to return to growth this quarter,” Cook said.\\nReleased in September, the iPhone 17 series drove up Apple’s smartphone sales by 29 per cent in the first two weeks of October, topping China’s sales chart, according to data released by Counterpoint Research on Friday.\\nThe total iPhone sales between September 29 and October 12 in China jumped 40 per cent year on year, driven by the value of the product, the demand for a smartphone upgrade, and the holiday shopping season, the Counterpoint report showed.\\nThe US company is locked in an intense competition with domestic brands in China, the world’s largest smartphone market.\\nBeijing-based Xiaomi, which made a bold move to challenge Apple with its Xiaomi 17 series, recorded a 21 per cent increase in the first two weeks of October, Counterpoint data showed.\\nFollowing Apple’s new iPhone releases, Xiaomi skipped directly to the Xiaomi 17 series after last year’s Xiaomi 15 line-up. Xiaomi founder and CEO Lei Jun said the new devices were “fully benchmarked against the iPhone and ready for head-to-head competition”.\\nIn addition to market competition, Apple is also under pressure to roll out its long-awaited artificial intelligence features in China. During a six-day visit in China earlier this month, Cook said that AI was “making a difference in people’s lives” and that the company was “working on getting [Apple Intelligence] into China right now”. He did not, however, provide a timeline.\\nApple Intelligence – a built-in AI feature of the company’s iOS 18, iPadOS 18 and macOS Sequoia operating systems – was announced in June last year. Chinese regulatory restrictions have made this feature unavailable in Apple devices used in mainland China and Hong Kong.\\n",

            "title": "PLA team releases photo of hypersonic ‘morphing’ missile that can change shape at Mach 5",
            "description": "Chinese military scientists have unveiled a rare glimpse into one of the most advanced frontiers of aerospace technology: a prototype of a morphing hypersonic vehicle capable of flying at speeds exceeding Mach 5.\\nThe missile, revealed in a published peer-reviewed paper, features a pair of retractable wings – a groundbreaking design that allows it to dynamically adapt its aerodynamic profile mid-flight.\\nWhen stowed inside the fuselage, the wings minimise drag for high-speed cruising. When extended, they generate additional lift and significantly improve manoeuvrability.\\nCrucially, the degree of wing deployment can be finely adjusted, enabling real-time changes to the vehicle’s overall aerodynamic shape and flight characteristics – a capability long considered the “holy grail” of hypersonic flight.\\nThe design was detailed in a paper published on October 20 in Acta Aeronautica et Astronautica Sinica, China’s leading aerospace journal, by a research team led by Professor Wang Peng from the College of Aerospace Science and Engineering at the National University of Defence Technology (NUDT).\\nThe study confirmed the vehicle’s novel control algorithms and key components had successfully passed hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) ground tests – a critical milestone indicating the system is not just theoretical, but viable for real-world deployment.\\n“High-speed morphing vehicles represent a cutting-edge direction in next-generation aerospace platforms,” the authors wrote.\\n\\n\\n“By dynamically adjusting their structure during flight to adapt to varying aerodynamic conditions, these vehicles demonstrate exceptional adaptability across wide speed and altitude ranges, offering significant potential for multi-role missions and enhanced penetration capabilities.\\n“Compared to traditional fixed-geometry high-speed vehicles, morphing vehicles can optimise aerodynamic performance in response to complex flight environments, dramatically improving manoeuvrability and mission flexibility.”\\nFor years, Chinese scientists have claimed their hypersonic weapons can target not only fixed installations but also highly mobile assets, including advanced stealth fighters like the F-22 and B-21 bomber.\\nThese assertions were met with scepticism – and even ridicule – from many Western experts, who long operated under the assumption that hypersonic missiles sacrifice manoeuvrability for speed. The prevailing dogma held that the faster a vehicle flies, the harder it is to steer.\\nBut China appears to have shattered that paradigm. During a massive parade on September 3, Beijing showcased the Changjian-1000 (CJ-1000) hypersonic cruise missile – a weapon reportedly capable of striking ground targets and engaging moving maritime threats such as aircraft carriers and airborne early-warning aircraft thousands of kilometres away, even if those targets attempt evasive manoeuvres.\\nDespite intense global speculation that the CJ-1000 employs morphing technology to achieve such unprecedented versatility, the missile was displayed fully enclosed in a protective canister, revealing no visible details.\\nNow, Wang’s research offers an extremely rare window into this once-secret technology.\\nControlling a vehicle at hypersonic speeds is inherently difficult. At Mach 5 and above, surface temperatures can exceed 2,000 degrees Celsius (3,632 Fahrenheit), triggering extreme physical and chemical changes in the airframe. Introducing morphing structures – like moving wings – multiplies the complexity.\\nThe shifting geometry generates massive uncertainty in aerodynamic models, demanding extraordinary computational power to calculate stable control commands in real time.\\n\\n\\nYet hypersonic platforms operate under severe constraints: limited on-board power, tight payload space and unforgiving battlefield conditions. The on-board flight computers, while highly reliable, cannot match the processing power of ground-based systems.\\nAs a result, control algorithms must be lightweight, ultra-efficient and resilient – capable of making split-second decisions with minimal delay.\\nEven more challenging is that mechanical actuators moving the wings are subject to inherent lag. Without precise control, these movements can induce high-frequency, destructive vibrations – a phenomenon known as “control chattering”, which can damage the vehicle or destabilise flight.\\nSuppressing such oscillations remains one of the most formidable challenges in morphing vehicle development worldwide.\\nWang’s team has now demonstrated a revolutionary control algorithm specifically designed to overcome these barriers.\\nTheir approach integrates high-order fully actuated system modelling, prescribed performance control and super-twisting sliding mode control – a sophisticated fusion of techniques that achieves high precision and robustness while drastically reducing computational load.\\nCritically, the algorithm has been verified in hardware-in-the-loop experiments, proving it can run in real time on embedded flight processors, similar to those used in actual missiles. In tests, the system achieved attitude tracking errors under 1 degree, with smooth, chatter-free actuator responses – validating its readiness for real-flight applications.\\nBeyond military use, morphing hypersonic technology holds transformative potential for civil aviation: enabling intercontinental flights in an hour or two, point-to-point global transport and efficient space access vehicles for reusable launch systems.\\nYet significant engineering challenges remain. The prototype photo reveals visible gaps where the wings extend – raising questions about thermal sealing under extreme heat, structural integrity and stealth performance.\\nKey challenges include preventing scorching plasma from penetrating the fuselage and minimising the radar cross-section despite moving parts.\\n",

            "title": "Trump’s Asia tour made US distaste for multilateralism obvious",
            "description": "Despite the superficial conviviality of Donald Trump’s whistle-stop tour through Asia this week, we watched first-hand the dysfunctional reality of the US’ disengagement from the world of multilateralism.\\nTrump delivered a speech at the US-Asean Summit in Malaysia, but skipped the main Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (Apec) leaders’ meeting in South Korea. Overall, he was more interested in cutting bilateral deals on the sidelines of the summits.\\nIn Malaysia, he finalised unilateral tariff agreements or frameworks with a handful of Association of Southeast Asian Nations members, but the substance of his discussions was elsewhere: rare-earths memorandums of understanding with Malaysia and Thailand, and a self-congratulatory celebration of his peacemaking skills in mediating an end to the Thailand-Cambodia conflict.\\nThe week also saw the first-ever meeting of leaders of the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP), which has Asean at its core, but also includes China, Japan, South Korea, Australia and New Zealand.\\nThe US is not part of RCEP, the world’s largest free-trade agreement, which covers 30 per cent of the world’s population and almost a third of global gross domestic product. For a unilateralist like Trump, such a grouping is clearly uninteresting.\\nTrump’s approach stands in contrast to that of Chinese Premier Li Qiang, who spoke of the need to “jointly uphold free trade and the multilateral trading system, oppose all forms of protectionism, and further advance the process of regional economic integration”.\\n\\n\\nFrom Kuala Lumpur, Trump flew on to Tokyo to meet Japan’s new prime minister Sanae Takaichi, before continuing on to South Korea for the annual Apec summit in Gyeongju. Here again, Trump’s itinerary was an essentially unilateral affair. First, he addressed a gathering of corporate bosses at the Apec CEO Summit. Then he flew to Busan for his summit with Chinese President Xi Jinping.\\nHe flew out of Korea before other leaders of the 21-member Apec forum began their discussions linked to Apec’s core objective of “free and open trade and investment” across the Asia-Pacific.\\nFor sure, Trump was under significant pressure to rush back to Washington, where the government has been shut down for almost five weeks. But anyway, the US president has no patience for Apec’s fundamental mission of building trust and multilateral cooperation. His “America first” agenda shares little in common with what Eduardo Pedrosa, executive director of Apec’s secretariat, on Monday applauded as “the steady process of building common ground in an increasingly divided world”.\\n\\n\\nThe US president’s appearances in Asia reflect the schizophrenic trade tensions that are likely to persist as long as Trump remains in power – a “world minus one” in which most nations remain convinced that multilateral cooperation is in the best interests of all, but in which the single most important economy has abandoned the need to make compromises and is set on bludgeoning any country that is perceived to obstruct US interests.\\nThere can be comfort in the past week’s steadfast endorsement at the Asean and Apec meetings of open trade and multilateral cooperation. Trump and his acolytes should note Singaporean Prime Minister Lawrence Wong’s remark in a recent interview: “The tariffs have certainly impacted America’s standing in Southeast Asia – there is no doubt.” They should also note that China, which since 2009 has been Asean’s largest trading partner, has been only too willing to fill the vacuum left by Trump’s transactional diplomacy.\\nBut it would be naive to think that we will not all be harmed by Trump’s attack on multilateral cooperation. Individual countries may suffer as unilaterally imposed tariffs squeeze their sales to one of the world’s most important markets. Even bigger casualties are likely to be the family of multilateral institutions like the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund, the World Trade Organization and the United Nations.\\n\\n\\nTrump has sharply reduced funding to the UN’s regular budget and peacekeeping. He has frozen US$5 billion in foreign aid. He has withdrawn from the Paris Climate Accord, World Health Organization, UN Human Rights Council and Unesco. He has disavowed the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals; the US ambassador to the UN in his Senate confirmation hearing said he wanted to ensure US funding “draws a straight and direct line to a compelling US national interest”.\\nTrump in February launched a comprehensive review of US engagement in all multilateral organisations, promising to deliver findings in August. The results of that review are long overdue, but that may just be a matter of keeping all in suspense and generating pressure for UN reform while a Damoclean sword is held overhead. As a commentary by the European Council on Foreign Relations observed in August, Trump may be “keeping one foot in wherever it deems convenient”.\\nAs Trump flew back to the US on Thursday, he was no doubt patting himself on the back for having successfully sealed a bundle of vote-winning bilateral tariff deals – not least his deal with China. But he should note that as he flew out, Xi Jinping was travelling on to Gyeongju for discussions with fellow Apec leaders. Most Apec economies have voiced a broad-based preference for multilateral cooperation. But as they glimpse Trump’s empty Apec seat across the room, they have to recognise that cooperation across a world minus one may be the best we can do for now.\\n",

            "title": "First Michelin Guide to the Philippines awards a single star to 8 outlets, Helm gets 2",
            "description": "The Philippines’ culinary landscape has entered a new era with the debut of its inaugural Michelin Guide on October 30. It is a move that has bestowed international prestige upon a handful of Manila’s restaurants while igniting a fervent debate among food lovers about representation and the future of Filipino fine dining.\\nThe ceremony was held for the first time in the capital, at the Manila Marriott Hotel at Newport World Resorts. It recognised 108 establishments in total, awarding a combined 10 stars to nine restaurants, as well as 25 Bib Gourmands (for good value for money) and 74 “Michelin Selected” entries. It also presented three special awards.\\n“The new era is innovative yet rooted, contemporary yet unmistakably Filipino,” said Gwendal Poullennec, international director of the Michelin Guide. “It tells a story of heritage and innovations, where sweet, salty, sour and umami harmonise to create flavours that are both comforting and exciting. Filipino cuisine is bold, generous and deeply personal.”\\nThe inaugural Michelin star selection for the Philippines formally integrates key players on the dining scene into the global gastronomic landscape. The guide’s debut for Manila, its Environs and Cebu saw nine restaurants awarded stars, led by Helm in Makati City, which received the country’s highest honour of two Michelin stars.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nView this post on Instagram\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nA post shared by MICHELIN Guide (official) (@michelinguide)\\n\\n\\n\\nThe accolade, reserved for restaurants with “excellent cooking worth a detour”, was received by chef-owner Josh Boutwood, who is also the mastermind behind Ember, The Test Kitchen and Savage.\\nHelm was praised by the guide for its thematic tasting menus that blend “gastronomy and theatre in a truly boundary-breaking experience”, showcasing the chef’s “boundless creativity and masterful technique”.\\nIn an interview after the event, Boutwood was emotional as he shared that the award came as an “extreme surprise”.\\n“When [single] stars were being given out, I saw all my friends getting up, I thought they skipped ‘H’ in the alphabet. I texted my wife, ‘I think I don’t have it,’” he said. Moments later, Helm was announced as the first and only restaurant in the Philippines with two Michelin stars.\\nEight establishments earned one star, including Toyo Eatery by chef Jordy Navarra, who previously trained at Bo Innovation in Hong Kong.\\n\\nNavarra noted that this recognition for Filipino cuisine was overdue. “Every restaurant, every name that gets called – everyone getting celebrated – is such a great thing for our dining scene. We’ve known all along that we have something to show the world.”\\nThe ceremony also featured three special awards: the young chef award went to Don Baldosano of Linamnam; the service award to Erin Recto of Hapag; and the exceptional cocktails award to Benjamin Leal of Uma Nota.\\nAdditionally, a dedicated Michelin Green Star, recognising leadership in sustainability, was awarded to Gallery by Chele for its commitment to sustainability and championing of Filipino produce.\\nThe guide’s arrival establishes a new benchmark for the Philippines’ culinary industry, offering a structured international framework that is expected to influence local dining culture and the country’s appeal as a destination for gastronomic tourism.\\nBelow is the full list of awards included in the Philippines’ first Michelin Guide.\\n2 Michelin stars\\nHelm\\n1 Michelin star\\n\\nAsador Alfonso\\nCelera\\nGallery by Chele\\nHapag\\nInatô\\nKasa Palma\\nLinamnam\\nToyo Eatery\\nBib Gourmand list\\nAbaseria Deli &amp; Cafe\\nBolero\\nBrick Corner\\nCabel\\nCochi\\nCur8\\nEm Hà Nội\\nEsmen\\nHálong\\nKumba\\nLa Pita\\nLampara\\nLasa\\nLos Tacos\\nManam at The Triangle\\nMorning Sun Eatery\\nPalm Grill (Diliman)\\nPares Batchoy Food House\\nPilya’s Kitchen\\nSarsa\\nSome Thai\\nTaqueria Franco\\nThe Pig &amp; Palm\\nThe Underbelly\\nYour Local\\nMichelin Selected\\n12/10\\nAbli\\nAida’s Chicken\\nAntonio’s\\nAto-Ah\\nAurora\\nAutomat\\nAyà\\nBenjarong\\nBlackbird\\nButcher Boy\\nCantabria by Chele Gonzalez\\nCanton Road\\nCarmelo’s Steakhouse\\nChie Chie’s Pancit Batil Patung\\nChina Blue\\nCirkulo\\nCoco\\nCru Steakhouse\\nDeo Gracias\\nDip\\nEl Poco Cantina (Malate)\\nEmber\\nEnye by Chele Gonzales\\nEsmeralda Kitchen\\nFong Wei Wu\\nFresca Trattoria\\nGinza Nagaoka\\nGordon Ramsay Bar &amp; Grill\\nGoxo\\nHouse of Lechon\\nIai\\nJuniper\\nKamakura\\nKei\\nKodawari (Salcedo)\\nLantaw (Compostela)\\nLocavore (Taguig)\\nLola Helen\\nLore\\nLusso (Legazpi)\\nMamacita\\nMan Ho\\nMaya\\nMetiz\\nMirèio\\nMōdan\\nNow Now\\nOak &amp; Smoke\\nOffbeat\\nOld Manila\\nOrigine\\nOsteria Antica\\nPablo\\nPapillon\\nPares Pares (N.

            "description": "Motorists from four Guangdong cities will be able to apply to enter Hong Kong under a new travel scheme from Saturday, while applications to drive into urban areas will open on December 9, the government has announced.\\nThe government said on Friday that applications for the “Park &amp; Fly” car park at the port would open at 9am on November 1, with operations commencing at midnight on November 15.\\nBoth sides also agreed that eligible mainland applicants may submit applications from 9am on December 9 to drive into Hong Kong’s urban area via the Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macau Bridge, starting from midnight on December 23, following agreements between the Guangdong and Hong Kong governments.\\nTo ensure orderly implementation, the scheme will initially accept applications from four Guangdong cities – Guangzhou, Zhuhai, Zhongshan and Jiangmen – before gradually extending to other cities in the province after six months.\\nUnder the “Southbound Travel for Guangdong Vehicles” scheme, eligible private cars from Guangdong can park at the automated car parks at the Hong Kong Port of the bridge.\\nDrivers and passengers may then transfer to flights via Hong Kong International Airport.\\nThe port offers 1,800 parking spaces with 24-hour automated parking and drop-off or pickup services.\\n\\nAlternatively, participants may enter Hong Kong using local transport or drive directly into the city via the bridge without obtaining a regular quota.\\nFor motorists wishing to enter the city’s urban area, the daily quota is set at 100 vehicles, with each vehicle allowed to stay in the city for up to three days. Applicants must first register for computer-based balloting through Guangdong’s information platform.\\nChief Executive John Lee Ka-chiu said the scheme, along with its northbound counterpart allowing Hong Kong vehicles to travel to the mainland, complemented each other in promoting the integrated development of the Greater Bay Area (GBA).\\n“The Hong Kong government is taking forward the Southbound Travel Scheme in a steady manner, with a view to benefitting Hong Kong residents and society as a whole, as well as sharing the fruitful achievements of the integrated development of the GBA,” he said.\\nThose utilising the scheme are expected to be high-spending individuals and families. The government will provide tourist parking guides to help participants plan their itineraries, offering suggested options related to transport, culture, sports, exhibitions, shopping and theme parks.\\nThe Guangdong Provincial Government also announced on Friday the regulations for the port car parks and urban entry under the Southbound Travel Scheme. These include detailed eligibility requirements for applicants, vehicles and drivers, insurance rules, port clearance procedures, driving necessities and mechanisms for handling non-compliance.\\n",
