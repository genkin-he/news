            "title": "I put myself on the Shanghai marriage market. It wasn’t pretty",
            "description": "In a previous column, I outed my pre-pandemic dating life as a middle-aged newly single Chinese woman in the United Kingdom.\\nSix months into my spreadsheet approach to love (100 daily Tinder swipes, 50 culls and a literacy-and-basic-human-decency filter), however, I decamped to China – on sabbatical, to research xiaolongbao, and for the anthropological thrill of being a shengnu (leftover woman) on home turf (sort of).\\nChina greeted me with a shrug. On Tinder and Baihe in Hong Kong, Shenzhen and Shanghai, a 40-something woman doing dozens of free swipes a day netted two to three matches a week. Hong Kong said hello, then ghosted. Shenzhen tried to sell me a pyramid scheme involving hair transplants and bee pollen for men and women of all ages.\\nShanghai, though, came with a wingwoman. G, a no-nonsense East German at the conservatory where I was on research leave, pushed me into Friday tango lessons on the ninth floor of an inner-city office building that had sprung parquet flooring and was all very earnestly renovated. The Shanghainese instructor, a severe taskmistress with a bloodhound’s nose for fakes, clocked my synthetic felt-bottomed heels (I swear I was conducting fieldwork for a dance anthropology project). Everyone else refused to swap partners. I left with a sprained ankle and a compendium of stern glares.\\nSo, on to the infamous weekend marriage market at People’s Square. G, a formidable matriarch fluent in love, duty and European bakeries in Shanghai, encouraged me with a mock-imperial flourish: “Go forth in the name of anthropology, discover and conquer.”\\nThe park is a prehistoric but ruthlessly efficient analogue of Tinder, run by parents with umbrellas. Elderly Chinese mothers and fathers tape their children’s vital stats to rain gear: gender, age, height, salary, square footage of the apartment already secured in a first-tier city, in that order.\\n\\nThe market has zones and sub-zones: by decade (1970s, 1980s, 1990s), by religion (there’s a Muslim area), by education level and province. To G’s delight, there’s also a special corner for divorced men stationed overseas, including London. “Now,” G instructed, “this is your moment. You will introduce yourself to these nice parents.”\\nAnd so I did.\\nMy first mistake was to have arrived without a marriage broker. A kindly couple in their 70s waved their son’s résumé at me – sadly, no photo for quality control – and apologised for his wretched divorced status. “They broke up because she was a shinu,” a stone woman who couldn’t have children, the mother explained, lowering her voice. “And whom might you be representing?”\\n“Er…myself.”\\nSilence. Full-body scan of my dumpling-filled and dumpling-shaped physique. “When were you born? 1980s? 1970s?”\\nMore silence. Then a sympathetic cough and a pat on the shoulder. “I’m afraid you’re a little too old. Such a waste, you do have qualifications. Since you also live in the West and are obviously Western-minded, attending this day by yourself.”\\n\\nWhat? No. I was chaperoned by my wingwoman, clearly. The mother mistook my puzzlement for heartbreak and added helpfully: “Maybe you can adopt?”\\nG began to huff, affronted and protective. As if on cue, this summoned an affable actual marriage broker who had been eavesdropping. He shrugged at my plight, then brightened at G. “Your friend, the blonde, if she’s up for it, I know a guy…not quite marriageable, but definitely interested …”\\nCue evil eye and baring of teeth. We retreated to the nearest scallion pancake stall for emergency – no, incensed – consumption. That marked the end of my Shanghai dating career.\\nWhat did I learn from representing myself in a public park in a country that is both ancestral land and study site?\\nThat pre-pandemic China could be brutally ageist, patriarchal and progeny-obsessed. That the parent-run market, for all its quaintness, is more efficient than modern apps: criteria stack neatly, expectations are blatant, and romance is an optional add-on you might install later, like an artificial intelligence-powered grammar check.\\nI learned something about my own limits. I was playing scientist with my love life: swipes, filters, variables. More data equals more dates equals more happiness, no?\\n\\nBack in London, this method reaped some results. In Shanghai, the model broke on cultural rock. Without a broker, without a photo, without the correct birth decade, without the right guanxi, I wasn’t just the wrong candidate; I was a category error.\\nFriends have since reported better weather. Post-pandemic, a few Chinese aunties I know navigated new-generation apps like Tantan, dodging love scams and finding their dream uncles. The landscape shifts; the code updates.\\nBut the auntie I was in pre-pandemic Shanghai decided to quit the lab. I would focus on myself. I would do morning yoga via internet tutorials (this yielded a slipped disc and a dislocated meniscus). I would eat fewer dumplings (I ate those dumplings). I would lose 7kg (I gained 10). I would climb Huangshan in Anhui without a cable car (I went to a panda reserve in Sichuan instead and made faces at those inconveniently cute creatures).\\nI waited out my time in East Asia, between Shanghai, Singapore, Hong Kong and Shenzhen. I pressed pause on the spreadsheets. And then I returned to London to restart the experiment with a mixture of caution and mischief.\\n",

            "description": "US President Donald Trump said he received an apology from Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney over a television ad that opposed tariffs, but suggested that trade talks between the two countries would not restart.\\nAsked by reporters aboard Air Force One whether negotiations between the White House and Carney’s government would resume, Trump said: “No, but I have a very good relationship. I like him a lot, but you know, what they did was wrong. He was very nice. He apologised for what they did with the commercial.”\\nEconomic data released by Statistics Canada on Friday showed the trade battle is taking a toll on the economy, with the numbers pointing to just 0.4 per cent annualised growth in the third quarter.\\nEarlier on Friday, US Energy Secretary Chris Wright said the goal is for the US and Canada to return to the table after talks broke off last week, and for the countries to cooperate more closely on oil, gas and critical minerals.\\nThere has been friction in the talks between Canada and the US “for some good reasons”, Wright told reporters at the Group of Seven energy and environment ministers’ meeting in Toronto on Friday.\\n\\nTrump called off the negotiations last week after the province of Ontario aired an anti-tariff advertisement in the US that drew from a 1987 radio address by former US president Ronald Reagan. Trump also threatened an additional 10 per cent tariff on Canada.\\nBefore the breakdown, Carney said the two countries had been progressing on a deal on steel and aluminium sectoral tariffs, as well as energy. Carney had pitched Trump on reviving the Keystone XL pipeline project.\\n“Unfortunately we’ve had some bumps on the road,” Wright said.\\n“I would say the goal is to bring those back together and I think to see cooperation between the United States and Canada across critical minerals, across oil and gas.”\\nTrump has also said recently that he was satisfied with the current trade arrangement between the US and Canada, which includes US import taxes on cars, timber, steel and aluminium, along with a 35 per cent tariff on other goods not shipped under the US-Mexico-Canada Agreement that Trump signed during his first term.\\n",

            "description": "Multiple people who had allegedly been plotting a violent attack over the Halloween weekend were arrested Friday in Michigan, FBI Director Kash Patel said in a social media post.\\nThe law enforcement effort was focused on suburban Detroit. Patel said more information would be released later.\\nInvestigators believe the plot was inspired by Islamic State extremism and are investigating whether those in custody were potentially radicalised online, according to two people briefed on the investigation who could not publicly discuss details. They spoke on condition of anonymity.\\nFBI and state police vehicles were in a neighbourhood near Fordson High School in Dearborn. People wearing shirts marked FBI walked in and out of a house, including one person who collected paper bags and other items from an evidence truck.\\nPolice in Inkster, another suburb, said FBI personnel were at a storage facility there.\\n\\n“There is no current threat to public safety,” said Jordan Hall, an FBI spokesman in Detroit, who declined further comment.\\nThe investigation involved discussion in an online chat room involving at least some of the suspects who were taken into custody, people familiar with the investigation said.\\nThe group had discussed carrying out an attack around Halloween, referring to “pumpkin day”, according to one of the people. The other person briefed on the investigation confirmed that there had been a “pumpkin” reference.\\nIt was not immediately clear if the group had the means to carry out an attack, but the reference to Halloween prompted the FBI to make arrests on Friday, one of the people said.\\nMichigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer said on social media that she had been briefed by Patel. She said she was grateful for “swift action” but offered no details.\\nResidents in the Dearborn neighbourhood watched as investigators worked at the house.\\n“It’s really scary because we have a lot of relatives around this neighbourhood,” said Fatima Saleh, who was next door.\\nSeparately, in May, the FBI said it arrested a man who had spent months planning an attack against a US Army site in suburban Detroit on behalf of the Islamic State group. The man, Ammar Said, did not know that his supposed allies in the alleged plot were undercover FBI employees.\\nSaid remains in custody, charged with attempting to provide support to a terrorist organisation. The criminal complaint was replaced in September with a criminal “information” document, signalling that a plea agreement could be possible in the months ahead.\\n",

            "title": "US judges order Trump administration to continue Snap food aid despite shutdown",
            "description": "Two federal judges ruled nearly simultaneously on Friday that US President Donald Trump’s administration must continue to fund Snap, the nation’s biggest food aid programme, using contingency funds during the government shutdown.\\nThe rulings came a day before the US Department of Agriculture planned to freeze payments to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Programme because it said it could no longer keep funding it due to the shutdown.\\nThe programme serves about one in every eight Americans and is a major piece of the nation’s social safety net.\\nWord in October that it would be a November 1 casualty of the shutdown sent states, food banks and Snap recipients scrambling to figure out how to secure food. Some states said they would spend their own funds to keep versions of the programme going.\\nThe programme costs around US$8 billion per month nationally.\\n\\nDemocratic state attorneys general or governors from 25 states, as well as the District of Columbia, challenged the plan to pause the programme, contending that the administration has a legal obligation to keep it running in their jurisdictions.\\nThe administration said it was not allowed to use a contingency fund with about US$5 billion in it for the programme, which reversed a USDA plan from before the shutdown that said money would be tapped to keep Snap running.\\nThe Democratic officials argued that not only could that money be used, it must be. They also said a separate fund with around US$23 billion was available for the cause.\\nA federal judge in Rhode Island ruled from a bench that the programme must be funded using at least the contingency funds – and asked for an update on progress by Monday.\\nA Massachusetts-based judge also gave the administration until Monday to say whether it would partially pay for the benefits for November with contingency money or fund them fully with additional funds\\nIt was not immediately clear how quickly the debit cards that beneficiaries use to buy groceries could be reloaded after the ruling. That process often takes one to two weeks.\\nThe rulings are likely to face appeals.\\nIn a hearing in Boston on Thursday on a legal challenge filed by the Democratic officials from 25 states, one federal judge seemed sceptical of the administration’s argument that Snap benefits could be halted.\\n\\nUS District Judge Indira Talwani told lawyers that if the government could not afford to cover the cost, there was a process to follow rather than simply suspending all benefits. “The steps involve finding an equitable way of reducing benefits,” said Talwani, who was nominated to the court by former US president Barack Obama.\\nTalwani seemed to be leaning towards requiring the government to put billions of dollars in emergency funds towards Snap. That, she said, was her interpretation of what Congress intended when an agency’s funding runs out.\\n“If you don’t have money, you tighten your belt,” she said in court. “You are not going to make everyone drop dead because it’s a political game someplace.”\\nGovernment lawyers say a contingency fund containing some US$5 billion cannot legally be used to maintain Snap, a programme that costs about US$8 billion a month. The states say it must be used for that purpose and point to more money available in a second federal account with around US$23 billion.\\nTalwani said her ruling would apply nationwide, not just in the states that are part of the challenge. That could defy the intentions of the US Supreme Court, which has limited the use of nationwide injunctions, though it has not prohibited them.\\nMeanwhile, states, food banks and recipients have been bracing for an abrupt shift in how low-income people can get groceries.\\nMost states have announced more or expedited funding for food banks or novel ways to load at least some benefits onto the debit cards used in the programme.\\nAdvocates and beneficiaries say halting the food aid would force people to choose between buying groceries and paying other bills.\\n\\nAt a Washington news conference on Friday, Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins, whose department runs Snap, said the contingency funds in question would not cover the cost of Snap for long.\\nSpeaking at a press conference with House Speaker Mike Johnson at the Capitol, she blamed Democrats for conducting a “disgusting dereliction of duty” by refusing to end their Senate filibuster as they hold out for an extension of healthcare funds.\\nA push this week to continue Snap funding during the shutdown failed in Congress.\\nTo qualify for SNAP in 2025, a family of four’s net income after certain expenses cannot exceed the federal poverty line, which is about US$31,000 per year.\\nLast year, Snap provided assistance to 41 million people, nearly two-thirds of whom were families with children, according to the lawsuit.\\n",

            "description": "Tanzania’s main opposition said hundreds had been killed in three days of election protests, with the country still under an internet blackout on Friday and the government denying any use of “excessive force”.\\nA security source and diplomat in Dar es Salaam both said that deaths were “in the hundreds” as protests continued on Friday.\\nPresident Samia Suluhu Hassan had sought to cement her position and silence critics in her party with an emphatic win in Wednesday’s election, in which her main challengers were either jailed or barred from standing.\\nBut the vote descended into chaos as crowds took to the streets of Dar es Salaam and other cities, tearing down her posters and attacking police and polling stations, leading to an internet shutdown and curfew.\\nForeign Minister Mahmoud Thabit Kombo said his government had “no figures” on any dead.\\n“Currently no excessive force has been used,” he said in an interview with Al-Jazeera. “There’s no number until now of any protesters killed.”\\n\\nBut the main opposition party, Chadema, said casualties were very high.\\n“As we speak the figure for deaths in Dar [es Salaam] is around 350 and for Mwanza it is 200-plus. Added to figures from other places around the country, the overall figure is around 700,” Chadema spokesman John Kitoka said.\\n“The death toll could be much higher,” he warned, saying killings could be happening during the nighttime curfew.\\nThe security source said they were hearing reports of more than 500 dead, “maybe 700-800 in the whole country”.\\nWith foreign journalists largely banned from covering the election and a communications blackout entering its third day, information from the ground has been scarce.\\nThe first toll from an international body came early Friday when the United Nations said it had “credible reports” of 10 dead, while Amnesty International said it had information of at least 100 killed.\\nMultiple hospitals and health clinics were too afraid to talk directly to Agence France-Presse.\\nHassan had yet to comment on the unrest and local news sites have not been updated since Wednesday.\\nArmy chief Jacob Mkunda late Thursday called the protesters “criminals”.\\n\\nIn Zanzibar, a tourist hotspot with its own semi-autonomous government, Hassan’s Revolution Party (Chama Cha Mapinduzi: CCM) had already been declared winner of the local vote on Thursday.\\nThe opposition party, ACT-Wazalendo, rejected the result, saying: “They have robbed the people of Zanzibar of their voice … The only solution to deliver justice is through a fresh election.”\\nA senior party official said that ballot boxes had been stuffed, people allowed to vote multiple times without ID and their election observers kicked out of counting rooms.\\nAt a meeting place for opposition supporters on Zanzibar, there was dismay and fear.\\n“There has never been a credible election since 1995,” said a 70-year-old man, referring to Tanzania’s first multiparty vote.\\nNone of those interviewed gave their names.\\n“We are afraid of speaking because they might come to our houses and pick us up,” said one.\\n\\nHassan has faced opposition from parts of the army and allies of her iron-fisted predecessor, John Magufuli, since she took over upon his death in 2021, analysts say.\\nThey said she wanted an emphatic victory to cement her position, and the authorities banned the main opposition party, Chadema, and put its leader on trial for treason.\\nIn the run-up to the vote, rights groups condemned a “wave of terror” in the east African nation, including a string of high-profile abductions that escalated in the final days.\\nMuch public anger has been directed at Hassan’s son, Abdul Halim Hafidh Ameir, accused of overseeing the crackdown.\\nACT-Wazalendo was allowed to contest the local election in Zanzibar, but its candidate was barred from competing against Hassan on the mainland.\\n",

However, the room for growth would be limited due to the absence of democrats.\\n“The competition is limited to a narrow range of pro-establishment opinion and does not represent the diversity of opinions we had in the past,” Burns said, adding that around 55 to 60 per cent of voters used to support pan-democratic candidates in previous elections until 2021.\\nThe first poll under Beijing’s “patriots-only” system in 2021 saw a turnout of 30.2 per cent in the geographical constituencies, the lowest since 1991.\\nLau Siu-kai, a consultant for the semi-official Chinese Association of Hong Kong and Macau Studies think tank, said the rising number of hopefuls in the geographical constituencies showed that the new electoral system had managed to attract more candidates to come out and contribute to the city.\\n“Now they know that they can make concrete contributions for the benefit of Hong Kong without getting into unnecessary political struggles, many will become more willing to run,” he said.\\nAmong the 10 constituencies, Kowloon Central is the most hotly contested, with six candidates running for two seats.\\nStarry Lee Wai-king, the city’s sole representative on the National People’s Congress Standing Committee, the country’s top legislative body, and Kitson Yang Wing-kit are eyeing another term representing the constituency.\\nWhile five candidates are contesting the two seats on Hong Kong Island West, three are incumbent lawmakers, implying that at least one will not be re-elected.\\nRegina Ip Lau Suk-yee, convenor of the city’s top decision-making Executive Council, who held one of its two seats, earlier announced her exit from Legco.\\n\\nIn the run-up to the election, a wave of lawmakers opted not to seek re-election, meaning a massive reshuffle in Legco is coming. A total of 28, or 31 per cent, of the city’s 89 legislators decided to step down, a record high since the city’s return to Chinese sovereignty in 1997. The number includes all 12 members aged 70 and above.\\nPrevious elections typically saw 10 to 20 per cent of incumbents not seeking re-election.\\nDistrict councillors have emerged as a key “talent pool” to fill the vacancies in geographical constituencies, with all but two of the 34 new contenders currently serving on district councils.\\nSo far, 134 people had officially submitted their nomination forms for the December 7 race, with 46 vying for geographical constituencies, 49 for the functional constituencies and 39 for the Election Committee constituency.\\nThe nomination period closes on November 6.\\nAdditional reporting by Willa Wu\\n",

            "title": "PLA team releases photo of hypersonic ‘morphing’ missile that can change shape at Mach 5",
            "description": "Chinese military scientists have unveiled a rare glimpse into one of the most advanced frontiers of aerospace technology: a prototype of a morphing hypersonic vehicle capable of flying at speeds exceeding Mach 5.\\nThe missile, revealed in a published peer-reviewed paper, features a pair of retractable wings – a groundbreaking design that allows it to dynamically adapt its aerodynamic profile mid-flight.\\nWhen stowed inside the fuselage, the wings minimise drag for high-speed cruising. When extended, they generate additional lift and significantly improve manoeuvrability.\\nCrucially, the degree of wing deployment can be finely adjusted, enabling real-time changes to the vehicle’s overall aerodynamic shape and flight characteristics – a capability long considered the “holy grail” of hypersonic flight.\\nThe design was detailed in a paper published on October 20 in Acta Aeronautica et Astronautica Sinica, China’s leading aerospace journal, by a research team led by Professor Wang Peng from the College of Aerospace Science and Engineering at the National University of Defence Technology (NUDT).\\nThe study confirmed the vehicle’s novel control algorithms and key components had successfully passed hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) ground tests – a critical milestone indicating the system is not just theoretical, but viable for real-world deployment.\\n“High-speed morphing vehicles represent a cutting-edge direction in next-generation aerospace platforms,” the authors wrote.\\n\\n\\n“By dynamically adjusting their structure during flight to adapt to varying aerodynamic conditions, these vehicles demonstrate exceptional adaptability across wide speed and altitude ranges, offering significant potential for multi-role missions and enhanced penetration capabilities.\\n“Compared to traditional fixed-geometry high-speed vehicles, morphing vehicles can optimise aerodynamic performance in response to complex flight environments, dramatically improving manoeuvrability and mission flexibility.”\\nFor years, Chinese scientists have claimed their hypersonic weapons can target not only fixed installations but also highly mobile assets, including advanced stealth fighters like the F-22 and B-21 bomber.\\nThese assertions were met with scepticism – and even ridicule – from many Western experts, who long operated under the assumption that hypersonic missiles sacrifice manoeuvrability for speed. The prevailing dogma held that the faster a vehicle flies, the harder it is to steer.\\nBut China appears to have shattered that paradigm. During a massive parade on September 3, Beijing showcased the Changjian-1000 (CJ-1000) hypersonic cruise missile – a weapon reportedly capable of striking ground targets and engaging moving maritime threats such as aircraft carriers and airborne early-warning aircraft thousands of kilometres away, even if those targets attempt evasive manoeuvres.\\nDespite intense global speculation that the CJ-1000 employs morphing technology to achieve such unprecedented versatility, the missile was displayed fully enclosed in a protective canister, revealing no visible details.\\nNow, Wang’s research offers an extremely rare window into this once-secret technology.\\nControlling a vehicle at hypersonic speeds is inherently difficult. At Mach 5 and above, surface temperatures can exceed 2,000 degrees Celsius (3,632 Fahrenheit), triggering extreme physical and chemical changes in the airframe. Introducing morphing structures – like moving wings – multiplies the complexity.\\nThe shifting geometry generates massive uncertainty in aerodynamic models, demanding extraordinary computational power to calculate stable control commands in real time.\\n\\n\\nYet hypersonic platforms operate under severe constraints: limited on-board power, tight payload space and unforgiving battlefield conditions. The on-board flight computers, while highly reliable, cannot match the processing power of ground-based systems.\\nAs a result, control algorithms must be lightweight, ultra-efficient and resilient – capable of making split-second decisions with minimal delay.\\nEven more challenging is that mechanical actuators moving the wings are subject to inherent lag. Without precise control, these movements can induce high-frequency, destructive vibrations – a phenomenon known as “control chattering”, which can damage the vehicle or destabilise flight.\\nSuppressing such oscillations remains one of the most formidable challenges in morphing vehicle development worldwide.\\nWang’s team has now demonstrated a revolutionary control algorithm specifically designed to overcome these barriers.\\nTheir approach integrates high-order fully actuated system modelling, prescribed performance control and super-twisting sliding mode control – a sophisticated fusion of techniques that achieves high precision and robustness while drastically reducing computational load.\\nCritically, the algorithm has been verified in hardware-in-the-loop experiments, proving it can run in real time on embedded flight processors, similar to those used in actual missiles. In tests, the system achieved attitude tracking errors under 1 degree, with smooth, chatter-free actuator responses – validating its readiness for real-flight applications.\\nBeyond military use, morphing hypersonic technology holds transformative potential for civil aviation: enabling intercontinental flights in an hour or two, point-to-point global transport and efficient space access vehicles for reusable launch systems.\\nYet significant engineering challenges remain. The prototype photo reveals visible gaps where the wings extend – raising questions about thermal sealing under extreme heat, structural integrity and stealth performance.\\nKey challenges include preventing scorching plasma from penetrating the fuselage and minimising the radar cross-section despite moving parts.\\n",
