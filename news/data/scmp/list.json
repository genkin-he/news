            "title": "How China’s retired teachers are helping bridge the urban-rural education divide",
            "description": "In 2021, when most of his peers were settling into retirement, 64-year-old Li Ming chose a different path. The law professor – already retired from a leading Beijing university – boarded a six-hour flight from the bustling capital to Tumxuk, a small city deep in western Xinjiang.\\nLi has remained there since, teaching multiple courses to hundreds of students at a local university as part of China’s Silver Age Teaching Programme – a sweeping state policy that mobilises a growing pool of retired urban educators to improve standards in underdeveloped regions.\\nThis year alone, Beijing plans to re-employ 7,000 retired teachers aged 65 and under to work in county towns and rural schools nationwide, according to a recent notice by the Ministry of Education and the Ministry of Finance.\\n“One of the biggest differences between urban education and rural education is the quality of the teachers,” said Scott Rozelle, the co-director of the Stanford Centre on China’s Economy and Institutions and its Rural Education Action Program.\\nAs China transitions into a high-income economy, narrowing educational disparities has become an urgent priority, he added, since human capital is an increasing driver of growth and social stability.\\n“When one looks at the share of the labour force that has been to high school, one worries that China’s human capital is not enough to keep it growing on a rapid path for the next several decades,” Rozelle said.\\nOnly about 35 per cent of China’s population had attended high school or higher in 2023, according to the country’s most recent statistical yearbook – a demographic reality underscored by the fact that one-third of its population remains rural.\\nIn contrast, OECD countries average 80 per cent, with half of that figure reaching tertiary education.\\nThese teachers already have pensions. This relieves county governments from financial strains\\nLiang Yan, Willamette University.\\nThe Silver Age Teaching Programme draws on the expertise of retired urban teachers to raise rural education standards. They assist school management by serving as vice-principals, teaching classes and mentoring local staff.\\nLi, for instance, has trained six teaching assistants in Xinjiang Uygur autonomous region over the past four years. All have been promoted to lecturers and now form a crucial part of the university staff.\\n“We senior teachers will eventually leave, but we must leave behind a team that will never leave,” he said in an interview with China Youth Daily earlier this year.\\nBut while the programme supplements the existing workforce – with tenures starting at one academic year and extensions available for strong performers – there are concerns that some localities could become too dependent on retired teachers, potentially delaying or limiting permanent recruitment, said Liang Yan, an economist at Willamette University.\\nSome schools have used the programme to fill teaching gaps caused by fluctuating enrolments. This avoids the risk of long-term permanent hires as student numbers dwindle due to demographic changes, according to a report by Xiong Bingqi, director of the Beijing-based 21st Century Education Research Institute.\\nThis has fuelled anxiety among young people, particularly recent university graduates, in an already challenging job market.\\nYouth unemployment in China has remained at worrying levels in recent years. In August, 18.9 per cent of those aged 16 to 24 – excluding students – were jobless, after a record summer graduation season.\\nThere is a clear financial incentive for localities and schools to hire older teachers.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“These teachers already have pensions,” Liang said. “This relieves county governments from financial strains.”\\nInstead of a regular salary, the programme provides an annual average stipend of 20,000 yuan for lecturers at the compulsory education level, split between the central and local governments. County governments are also responsible for providing accommodation.\\nBy contrast, hiring younger workers requires significant employer contributions to social insurance – covering pensions, housing loans and medical insurance – raising costs, especially as Beijing has started to clamp down on businesses that avoid these obligations.\\nYoung college graduates are also often reluctant to relocate to rural areas to teach, Rozelle said. While sending experienced urban teachers to rural schools helps, it only provides a temporary fix since the high turnover rate means localities must continually recruit temporary staff, he added.\\nRozelle argued that a better solution would be to encourage rural households to move to cities and enrol their children in better-resourced urban schools – something that has been very difficult to do until recently.\\n“Many third- and fourth- and fifth-tier cities are now encouraging rural people from their county to come rent or buy an apartment inside the city and send their kids to urban schools,” he said.\\nRecent urbanisation reforms have supported this by relaxing pathways for rural migrants to gain hukou – the residency permit that unlocks access to crucial public services.\\nAnyone moving to cities with fewer than 3 million residents can now qualify for local hukou after just six months of living and working there.\\n",

            "description": "A man in Turkey has agreed to pay his ex-wife 10,000 liras (US$240) every quarter in “cat support”.\\nHis move sets a new precedent for divorces in the pet economy era, which is booming with Turkey’s pet population reaching 20.9 million in 2023.\\nAccording to Turkish media outlet Yenisafak, a couple in Istanbul decided to divorce after two years of marriage due to serious relationship issues.\\nThe man, identified as Bugra, and his former partner, Ezgi, had jointly cared for two cats.\\n\\nIn the divorce settlement, Ezgi was granted custody of the cats, and Bugra agreed to pay her 10,000 liras every three months for the next 10 years to cover their care, including food, vaccinations and other expenses.\\nThe payments, based on a cat’s average 15-year lifespan, will be adjusted annually for inflation and will cease once the pets die.\\nBugra will also pay Ezgi 550,000 liras (US$13,000) in financial compensation.\\nTurkish lawyer Aylin Esra Eren said that pet owners in Turkey typically microchip their pets, making the registered person the pet’s legal guardian.\\nEven if the owners separate, the animals’ health, care and emotional needs must still be met.\\n\\nTurkey’s animal protection law treats pets as “living beings” rather than “property”, meaning abandoning a pet is considered both animal abuse and a legal violation.\\n“Pets that are not properly cared for will become strays, and abandoning microchipped pets on the streets is illegal,” said Eren.\\nPeople who abandon pets in Turkey can be fined up to 60,000 liras (US$1,400).\\nThe lawyer also said that the case has significant implications for divorce trends in the country.\\nShe explained that caring for cats requires attention to their food, mood and health, much like raising a child.\\nThe case is the first to legally define pet care responsibilities, offering legal protection for pets as family members.\\n\\nHowever, Eren said that Bugra’s payments cannot be considered alimony, as under local laws, that can only be requested by a spouse or children.\\nIn Turkey, alimony may be paid to a financially needy spouse after divorce, based on factors like income, marriage length and living standards.\\nThe story has caused a buzz on social media.\\nOne online observer said: “It is great to see growing respect for the status of pets. I hope more countries follow this example and recognise the legal rights of animals.”\\n“We should be cautious because some people may use pets as bargaining chips in a divorce, leading to unnecessary issues,” said another.\\n",

            "title": "What Syria’s post-war pivot to China tells us about the new world order",
            "description": "Early this month, Syria’s Foreign Minister Asaad al-Shaibani is expected in Beijing for what both sides have billed as a “reset” in relations. The move reflects a wider trend across the Middle East, where governments wary of Western conditionality are increasingly seeking what they view as less encumbered partnerships with China.\\nThe winds of realpolitik are sweeping from the Middle East to Central and South Asia, bringing “hard resets” across entire regions. India’s quiet pivot towards the Taliban and Russia’s renewed rapprochement in Syria and Afghanistan signal a world in flux.\\nWhen Syrian President Ahmed al-Sharaa took the podium at the 80th United Nations General Assembly in September, it was more than a diplomatic debut; it was the first speech by a Syrian head of state in nearly 60 years.\\nSharaa’s message was direct: Syria wants recognition, investment and the end of sanctions. But his overtures extended beyond the West.\\nForeign Minister Asaad al-Shaibani has made clear that Syria views China as indispensable to its reconstruction\\n\\nIn recent months, Damascus has been looking towards Beijing, dispatching envoys and indicating a broader reorientation of its foreign policy towards the East. China’s strategy of “balanced vagueness” towards Syria suggests that engagement with the new leadership, dominated by Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, once labelled a terrorist organisation, will be slow and driven by a careful weighing of risks and opportunities.\\nFrom a Syrian standpoint, Shaibani’s priorities in Beijing are straightforward: economic and counterterrorism cooperation. He has made clear that Syria views China as indispensable to its reconstruction, an effort the World Bank estimates will cost US$216 billion.\\nNeighbouring nations are already taking a leading role in Syria’s reconstruction. Saudi Arabia has pledged US$6.4 billion in investments focusing on infrastructure, real estate and information technology. Turkey is spearheading efforts to rebuild power plants, roads and ports, and Qatar has signed a US$7 billion energy deal. Meanwhile, the United Arab Emirates has moved swiftly with a US$800 million agreement to manage the strategic port of Tartus.\\nEven under former Syrian leader Bashar al-Assad, Damascus held high hopes for large-scale Chinese investment following reconstruction and trade summits in 2018. At the time, Chinese state-owned enterprises pledged around US$2 billion and bilateral trade reached US$1.3 billion in 2019. However, despite China’s provision of medical supplies during the Covid-19 pandemic, its overall economic engagement fell short of Syrian expectations. A similar pattern may be emerging now.\\n\\nBeijing’s own demands are on the table since Shi Hongwei, China’s ambassador in Damascus, met Sharaa. Syria may rank low on Beijing’s list of Middle Eastern priorities, but the uncertainty radiating from Damascus carries risks that cannot be ignored.\\nThe spectre of terrorist networks exploiting the chaos and the possibility of that threat spilling from the Middle East into Central Asia, China’s near abroad, is stirring unease in Beijing.\\nAt the heart of China’s anxiety lies the presence of Uygur foreign fighters embedded within Syria’s defence apparatus. The newly formed Division 84 is reportedly designed to absorb foreign combatants into the Syrian army and eventually Syrian society – families included. Among them are an estimated 3,500 battle-hardened Uygur fighters from the Turkestan Islamic Party.\\nWhile these forces may not pose an immediate threat to China or Central Asia, their continued presence, and Sharaa’s declared support for a group that spilled blood to assure his victory on the battlefield, have Beijing on edge. It was no coincidence that Chinese envoy Fu Cong recently warned the UN Security Council that foreign terrorist fighters remained active in Syria and urged Damascus to meet its counterterrorism obligations.\\nStill, this month’s diplomatic mission itself marks an important step forward for Syria’s new government, in a moment where symbolism may matter as substance. For Sharaa’s administration, engagement with China offers a pathway to legitimacy and leverage, and a means of signalling that Syria is not entirely beholden to Turkey.\\n\\nFor Beijing, deepening ties with Damascus fits neatly with its long-term strategy to broaden its footprint in the Middle East. At the same time, Chinese diplomats are watching Ankara closely. Turkey has emerged as the new regional kingmaker, wielding growing influence through its early backing of Sharaa, its military presence along Syria’s northern border, and its pledge to train and arm the new Syrian army.\\nAmid simmering tensions between Israel and Iran, a renewed outbreak of violence is a possibility that cannot be ignored. In this volatile context, stability and sustainable development in Syria have become essential, not only to prevent sectarian flare-ups against the country’s minorities but also to contain potential ripple effects that could spread across Iraq and other regions central to China’s energy security.\\nWhether this emerging partnership will lead to meaningful reconstruction remains uncertain. Yet even a fragile regional balance could reopen the door for China’s return, allowing Beijing to move beyond symbolic diplomacy and deploy its preferred foreign policy instrument: investment.\\nOne thing is clear, however. As the old order in the Middle East continues to fracture, Syria’s eastward gaze reflects more than a tactical pivot; it embodies a shifting global balance of power and a quiet acknowledgement that the path back to relevance no longer runs only through Western support.\\nDr Alessandro Arduino is an affiliate lecturer at the Lau China Institute, King’s College London, specialising in the convergence of technological innovation and national security.\\n",

            "title": "UBS, HKEX and Standard Chartered’s women CEOs on blazing a trail and finding balance",
            "description": "In most global financial centres, women chief executives remain a rarity. In Hong Kong, they are increasingly part of the landscape. Among them are Amy Lo Choi-wan of UBS, Mary Huen Wai-yi of Standard Chartered and Bonnie Chan Yiting of Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing, members of Women Chief Executives Hong Kong (WCE) and co-organisers of Monday’s Women Chief Executives Summit in the city.\\nLo describes the beginnings of WCE as spontaneous, just a handful of women meeting over lunch. “We thought we should do something together,” she says. “We are all very passionate about helping next-gen women to excel in their careers.”\\nThose informal gatherings have since evolved into an organised network, formalised in 2018, with 60 women CEOs leading financial institutions and working groups dedicated to advocacy (led by Lo and Huen), education, well-being and fostering young talent.\\nWhat sets WCE apart is its unlikely alliance: competitors coming together in a notoriously guarded industry.\\n“Covid made us closer,” says Huen. “It wasn’t about who wins; it was about how to sail through the crisis together.” As the group grew, she says, they asked, “How do we use the soft power of women to support Hong Kong?”\\nThis week’s inaugural summit was a start, and it brought together 200 women C-suite executives from around the region and the world under one roof.\\nMore than a decade after Sheryl Sandberg and her “Lean In” ideology turned personal ambition into feminist buzzwords, WCE offers a different model, focused less on individual breakthrough and more on structural change and coming together.\\n“For this little city of Hong Kong to be able to produce a group of 60 women CEOs, just in the financial services space,” says Chan, “is phenomenal.”\\nMeet Lo, Huen and Chan, who are leading the change, each bringing her own convictions and beliefs to the role of chief executive.\\nBonnie Chan\\nCEO, Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing\\n\\nBonnie Chan belongs to what she calls “the 5am club”. She wakes up at 4.30am each day, eats a small breakfast and lifts weights at the gym before heading into the office, usually arriving by 7am. In the evenings, she’s on the bike for an hour – cardio as decompression. “That’s the way I keep up my energy level,” she says. “It’s my ‘me’ time.”\\nThat time is as much mental as physical. “The morning session is very helpful. As I exercise, I plan ahead for the day,” she says. “In the evening, it’s about reflecting on what happened and doing a little bit of planning ahead. I find that helpful in keeping my balance.”\\nSince March 2024, Chan has led Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing (HKEX) through what she describes as a period of recalibration amid economic uncertainties. “We were labelled a relic of an inter­national financial centre,” she says. “I think now we are really back.”\\nShe’s not one for corporate posturing. “I’m more interested in what I can do for the team than what the team can do for me,” she says. “Spending quality time with my colleagues, solving problems together – that’s what I really like to do.” Active collaboration is how she keeps up with what the rest of the organisation is doing on a day-to-day basis.\\nIn a couple of years, we’ve added 800 female directorships to Hong Kong\\nBonnie Chan\\nHer route to the top wasn’t shaped by titles or targets. “I don’t think I’ve ever been very conscious about the fact,” she says, when asked about ambition. “It’s more people around me, telling me that I am ambitious.” As a student, a classmate once told her she was always the first to arrive. “I just wanted to be engaged and involved in every learning experience. I didn’t want to miss out on any opportunity.”\\nThat instinct for participation has, over time, scaled up to policy. In 2024, HKEX introduced a new rule requiring all listed companies in Hong Kong to appoint at least one woman to their board – a move Chan backed strongly. “We became one of the very first jurisdictions in the world to mandate that,” she says. “In a couple of years, we’ve added 800 female directorships to Hong Kong. It’s still a small step, but an impactful step nonetheless.”\\nEarly reactions were mixed. “Some said it should be merit based, or that there isn’t a strong enough pipeline, but we did our homework,” she says. “Hong Kong has more women than men. Women receive the same level of education. They enter the labour force at the same time.” Now that the rule is in place, she sees companies looking at a much bigger base for talent. “They’re not just looking at less than 50 per cent of the population any more.”\\nIf there’s a common thread through Chan’s outlook, it’s momentum. “The more women enter the pipeline, the more you build that pipeline,” she says. “It becomes a virtuous cycle.”\\nMary Huen\\nCEO, Hong Kong and Greater China &amp; North Asia, Standard Chartered\\n\\nMary Huen never planned to become a CEO. But when the question came up during an interview, her answer was simple: “Why not?”\\nIt’s a mindset that has shaped the way she works. “You never settle for the status quo,” she says. “I always describe the CEO’s role as about moving the mountain.” She sees ambition less as a drive for position than as a drive for possibility. “Deep inside, you realise: I want to create something new and really make a difference in the legacy.”\\nThat drive doesn’t look the way people expect. “Perhaps some would say I’m too friendly. I’m too collaborative,” she says. “You run an army of 4,000 people. You go to the branch to see them. You’re a cheerleader for the army. You carry a smile rather than commanding authority.” She calls it a ‘quiet ambition’, one that challenges the default image of the CEO. “The purpose and the mission are not different. It’s just the way to express it which differs.”\\nHuen has spent almost her entire working life at Standard Chartered. “This is my second job,” she says. “I was a management trainee in an American bank. I met my husband there, so we said it is a concentration risk.” At Standard Chartered, she moved from marketing to lending and credit cards to investment and private banking. “Every one of those roles had its challenges,” she says. “Like yoga, you stretch, and after that, you feel more relaxed.”\\nI want to create something new and really make a difference in the legacy\\nMary Huen\\nThe biggest stretch came when she stepped into a regional leadership role that moved her beyond Hong Kong. She quickly realised that her usual instincts didn’t always translate. “In the beginning, I tended to use the Hong Kong experience,” she says. “It didn’t work.” What worked was listening and learning how others see the world. “You have to understand their lens to support them.”\\nThat same openness helped her lead the creation of Mox, Standard Chartered’s digital bank. “People said, ‘It’s very, very difficult. You’re the first to do that. Is it too high of an ambition for us?’” she recalls. “I just kept asking, ‘Why not?’”\\nHer focus now is on making space for new ideas and for the next generation. “Don’t expect what got you here will also get them here,” she says of the next wave of leadership. “They want flexibility. They are entrepreneurial. They are digitally savvy.”\\nThat shift, she believes, demands new structures inside old institutions. “Skills are important, but I’m less worried about them,” she says. “How can we create an environment where they feel they have the psychological safety to speak their minds?”\\nAway from work, Huen is deliberate about recharging. “I cook with my family, go on trips, gather for meals,” she says. “That kind of time injects new energy.”\\nBut when she truly wants to switch off, she heads to Africa – not for business, but for the quiet. “Sitting in the dark, facing nature … you’re not reflecting on your career,” she says of her love for safaris, “it’s about your personal journey.”\\nAmy Lo\\nChairman, UBS Global Wealth Management Asia Head and CEO, UBS Hong Kong\\n\\nAmy Lo is often asked how she sustains the pace. She’s been at UBS for 30 years, and now leads its Asia-Pacific wealth management division and serves as CEO of UBS Hong Kong. “People ask where my energy comes from,” she says. “I think it boils down to passion, and purpose.”\\nThat sense of purpose shapes how she approaches leadership. “My purpose when I wake up is to make a difference both to the client – helping them to achieve their own purpose in life, legacy, succession, growth – and to the team,” she says. “Bringing the fun part and the pride of working for UBS. And to really take people under your wing to help them to be successful.”\\nThe third piece, she adds, is about impact beyond the office. Since the UBS-Credit Suisse merger, completed last year, “we are managing over US$6 trillion of assets”, she notes. “That gave us both aspirations and a sense of corporate responsibility: how are we going to turn this capital into philanthropic capital?” She serves on the board of the UBS Optimus Foundation, where she collaborates with clients on strategies that address global challenges.\\nOver time, she’s watched the idea of legacy expand beyond wealth transfer. “In previous generations, a lot of principals cared about maintaining the family legacy – all the wealth would stay with the family and the succession planning would be within the family,” she says. “Over the years, the idea of legacy goes beyond just family. It’s beyond just quantitative legacy; it’s what kind of family values and what kind of contribution to the community you want to pass on.”\\nPeople ask where my energy comes from ... it boils down to passion, and purpose\\nAmy Lo\\nThat shift has been accelerated by the next generation. “Nowadays, [there’s a focus on] topics like climate change, ESG [environmental, social and governance] and anything that is sustainable, scalable and impactful,” she says. “It’s beyond just the family. It’s, ‘Am I helping address the world’s problems?’”\\nWhen she entered the industry, that kind of language was rare, and so were women in senior roles. “When I started, it was very much a male-dominated industry,” she says. “That’s the reason why, as a woman from Asia, I was quite determined to make sure that we have fair representation both in the region as well as globally.”\\nMentors – some of them colleagues, some long-time clients – have played a key role in her career. “A lot of them are very successful female entrepreneurs,” she says. “That gave me a lot of inspiration.”\\nLo is disciplined about balance. She plays golf early in the morning, often before work. “It helps me clear my mind,” she says. She loves to cook (“Lobster noodles are a favourite”), travel with friends and family, and spend time with her seven dogs.\\n“You have to take care of yourself, body and mind,” she says. “That’s what keeps you going.”\\n",

            "description": "China’s Ministry of Commerce on Saturday said it is looking to exempt some Nexperia orders from an export ban that it imposed after the Netherlands seized control of the Chinese-owned Dutch chipmaker.\\n“We will comprehensively consider the actual situation of enterprises and grant exemptions to exports that meet the criteria,” a ministry representative said in a statement.\\nAccording to the ministry, exemptions were being considered to stabilise the supply of Nexperia chips in global supply chains. It encouraged affected companies to reach out and request such an exemption.\\nBeijing’s latest action reflects some of the inroads made between Chinese President Xi Jinping and his US counterpart, Donald Trump, during their meeting on Thursday in Busan, South Korea.\\nA report by The Wall Street Journal on Saturday said Nexperia would resume sending chips under a framework agreement reached during the Xi-Trump talks.\\nAfter the meeting, the Ministry of Commerce said Washington would temporarily halt the implementation of its so-called 50 per cent subsidiary rule.\\nIntroduced in late September, the rule expanded US export restrictions to any company that was at least 50 per cent owned by entities on Washington’s trade blacklist. Wingtech Technology, the Chinese owner of Nexperia, was added to the blacklist in December last year.\\n\\nIn response to Dutch authorities’ takeover of Nexperia on September 30, citing national security concerns, Beijing on October 4 issued a ban on Nexperia China and its subcontractors from exporting finished components produced in the country.\\nAbout 70 per cent of all Nexperia products are assembled in its factory in Dongguan, in southern Guangdong province.\\nBeijing’s one-year export ban was expected to complicate efforts to settle the row over Nexperia, a critical supplier of semiconductors for automotive, industrial, mobile and consumer applications.\\nIn the Ministry of Commerce statement on Saturday, China also denounced the Netherlands for “inappropriately intervening in corporate affairs” after it seized control of Nexperia, which has led to “a global supply chain turmoil”.\\nThe Hague did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\\nNexperia’s China production facility in Dongguan had sharply scaled down production, according to a Monday report by the Post.\\nThe Dutch chipmaker had informed Japanese car component makers that it may not be able to guarantee chip deliveries, the Japan Automobile Manufacturers Association said last week. Volkswagen also warned that disruptions to Nexperia’s chip supply could affect its production.\\nMeanwhile, Japanese carmaker Honda’s plants in the US and Mexico have hit a production hiatus over the chip shortage caused by the Nexperia row, according to separate reports by The Wall Street Journal and Nikkei Asia.\\nNexperia’s China unit had openly defied directives from the Dutch head office, telling employees and customers that it intended to operate independently.\\n",
