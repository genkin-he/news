Submissions should not exceed 400 words\\nHalloween is surely one of the most fun and frivolous of all the annual festivities in Hong Kong. On October 31 every year, Lan Kwai Fong is thronged with party-goers in their spooky get-ups, while children run around, wide-eyed and delighted, trick-or-treating with their friends.\\nContrary to the popular belief that Halloween is an American custom, most will be surprised to learn that the origins of Halloween are, in fact, Irish and we have been celebrating it for over 2,000 years.\\nThe ancient Celts called it Samhain (pronounced sow-win) and it was originally celebrated to mark the end of the harvest season and the start of winter. They believed that Samhain was the time of year when the spirit realm was closest to the earthly world, and the souls of the dead would cross to the other side. To blend in with the wandering spirits, the ancients Celts wore masks to disguise themselves and lit large communal fires to ward off evil spirits and ghouls – familiar Halloween practices that continue today all over the world.\\nOther Halloween traditions that came from Ireland include carving faces into turnips (later pumpkins) as a form of protection, and trick-or-treating, where people would go from door to door in fabric masks, offering prayers for the dead in exchange for food.\\nThe endurance of Halloween’s relevance and appeal is a result of the many Irish emigrants who brought the traditions of the harvest celebration to their new homes in America and other countries around the world. These customs and traditions were embraced and developed into the Halloween we know and love today.\\nSo whether you are trick-or-treating with your family today or dressing up for a night out with your friends in LKF, remember that Ireland is the home of Halloween.\\nJennifer Bourke, consul general of Ireland to Hong Kong and Macau\\nIs South Korea a reliable US ally?\\nAmid international turbulence and the strengthening of relations between China, Russia and North Korea, the United States, Japan and South Korea are attempting to further enhance trilateral cooperation. Thus, during the recent meeting between the US Secretary of State and the foreign ministers of Japan and South Korea, the countries agreed to continue conducting the trilateral multi-domain exercise Freedom Edge to counter the threat posed by North Korea’s nuclear and ballistic missile programmes.\\nHowever, it is worth considering whether Seoul is a reliable ally.\\nLast year, an official at the Korea Defence Intelligence Command (KDIC) was arrested for leaking classified data, including a list of undercover operatives who were carrying out missions in China and Russia.\\nThis came at a time when South Korea was expanding military intelligence sharing with the US and Japan to help guard against North Korea and China. It prompted the KDIC to recall undercover agents back home as many of them had no diplomatic immunity, which left them vulnerable to arrests, threats and blackmail in foreign countries. Earlier, a major leak was reported at the command in 2018.\\nIn addition, South Korean spies seem to be failing abroad. In March 2024, it was reported that a South Korean was detained in Russia on spying charges. In October 2024, it was confirmed that another South Korean was arrested in China for spying. Washington and Tokyo should take a closer look at cooperation with Seoul.\\nBenjamin Campbell, Alabama, US\\nBritish flags should not be used to intimidate\\nCliff Buddle is correct in his article, “A national flag should be a symbol of unity not of prejudice and divisiveness” (October 19).\\nThe far right in the United Kingdom, including the populist Reform party, utilise the union jack, often displayed upside down, to confer on themselves alone self-righteous patriotism. When held by a jack-booted thug, the flag becomes threatening. Others even shroud themselves in flags on marches as if they are protecting themselves from “evil outside forces”, i.e. foreigners.\\nIt was, as Buddle described, an excellent trick for Labour to produce hundreds of jolly paper union jacks for delegates to wave at their party conference. It made the use of our national flags to intimidate look rather foolish.\\nSally Wilton, Dorset, UK\\n",

            "title": "Plastic rain: Indonesia sounds alarm as microplastics found in Jakarta’s rainwater",
            "description": "A new study has found that rainwater in Indonesia’s capital Jakarta contains microplastics and potentially other toxic chemicals harmful to public health, raising alarm over the pervasiveness of such particles in the country’s biome – down to food consumed.\\nRaindrops were picking up microplastics floating in Jakarta’s, Indonesia’s National Research and Innovation Agency (BRIN) revealed in its newest study on October 17. Samples of rainwater collected in coastal areas of Jakarta were found to contain about 15 microplastic particles for every one square metre (11 sq ft) per day.\\n“If a house has an area of around 100 square metres (1,080 sq ft), it means that every day it will be hit by [rainwater] with 1,500 microplastic particles,” Muhammad Reza Cordova, a BRIN researcher who took part in the study, told This Week in Asia.\\nResearchers found that these microscopic flakes contained synthetic fibres from clothing, polymers from tyres, and smaller pieces of plastics that broke down from combustion and degradation, among others.\\n“We already suspected that there were microplastics in the air. But it was surprising because we thought the numbers wouldn’t be that high. We thought there would be just one or two microplastic particles [per square metre],” Muhammad said.\\n\\nAccording to him, rain helps trap microplastics in the air so “the higher the rainfall, the more microplastics are cleaned from the air we breathe every day”.\\nHowever, the study should be an “alarm” for the public as it showed that microplastics were so widespread in Indonesia that they could be found “in all kinds of metrics or ecosystem levels, from water to soil and air”, Muhammad said.\\nIn August, Muhammad and his team found microplastic particles and fibres in deep sea barnacles at a depth of 200 metres (656 feet) in the northern Maluku and southwestern Philippine seas, likely from abandoned fishing gear.\\nLast year, a collaborative study between BRIN and several universities in Indonesia and China detected microplastic particles five metres (16 feet) below the surface in the water surrounding the archipelago, from North Java and North Sulawesi to the Maluku Sea.\\nMicroplastics have also been found in water collected on Japan’s Mount Fuji and Mount Oyama, as well as in rain from several national parks in the western United States.\\nDeadly cocktail\\nYuyun Ismawati, senior adviser at Nexus3 Foundation, a non-governmental organisation advocating for the eradication of dangerous chemicals, said that microplastics were risky to health as they were a “magnet” for air pollutants and toxic additive chemicals that made up a plastic fibre.\\n“What worries me isn’t just the microplastics; I’m more concerned about the chemicals [in microplastics]. Plastic fibre is made with chemical additives so that the plastic is flexible, durable in the air, and when exposed to sunlight, it does not easily fragment,” the London-based adviser said.\\n“There’s a cocktail effect of all the existing pollutants that makes it scary. If people inhale or come into contact with microplastics in rainwater, they also [inhale] the chemicals in them.”\\nThere’s a cocktail effect of all the existing pollutants that makes it scary\\nYuyun Ismawati, senior adviser at Nexus3 Foundation\\nAccording to Yuyun, only a fraction of these compounds are detectable, while “ultra fine” particles are hard to measure due to technology limitations in Indonesia to sample and examine them.\\nMultiple studies have found that exposure to microplastics can cause serious health impacts, such as hormonal disruption, damage to organs like lungs and kidneys and cancer development.\\nExperts said that weak management of plastic waste was to blame for the plastic rain phenomenon.\\n“The source is from open dumping sites, temporary waste storage sites and landfills. Many Indonesian landfills are not covered or not operated properly, so that when plastics are fragmented, they break into small particles and these become airborne,” Yuyun said.\\n\\n\\nIn Indonesia, microplastics are also found in the very food that they eat. Last year, Nexus3 Foundation and environmental group The Gita Pertiwi Foundation found microplastics in “the blood, meat and innards” of two cows that grazed the soils in two landfills in Central Java, Yuyun said.\\nAnother study by Cornell University last year, which mapped microplastic uptake across 109 countries, found that Indonesians topped the chart with 15 grams (0.5 ounces) of microplastics consumed per month, more than any other country.\\nMalaysians ranked second at 12 grams (0.4 ounces) per month, followed by Filipinos and Vietnamese, who consumed 11 grams (0.3 ounces) per month. In Indonesia, most of the microplastics came from seafood, the study said.\\nMask up\\nResponding to the study, Health Minister Budi Sadikin on Tuesday recommended Jakartans to mask up while doing outdoor activities, or “try not to walk outside after it rains”.\\nMuhammad argued, however, that it was better to breathe post-rain air in Jakarta as the rain had cleansed it of pollutants, rather than when it was dry.\\n“We recommend using the masks when it’s dry, but use the ones that are made from natural fibres like cotton. Medical masks are disposable, and we are concerned that this will increase plastic waste, as medical masks contain plastic polymers,” he said.\\nOn Tuesday, Jakarta Governor Pramono Anung said that the city of 10 million would soon have a waste-to-energy plant.\\n\\nBut Muhammad said that was only part of the solution as it did not address the root of the problem. “We must stop it at the source by reducing single-use plastics, as 70 per cent of our plastics production is single-use. If not managed properly, it will become a time bomb for us,” he said.\\nIn Indonesia, the quality of plastic made for consumer products is “poor”, so they cannot be recycled and end up in landfill, while plastic recycling companies prefer to import plastic from abroad because the quality is better, according to Yuyun.\\nAs microplastics have permeated every corner of the Earth, Yuyun also urged countries to agree on the United Nations Plastics Treaty, which would establish legally binding rules around plastic disposal and production.\\nIn August, the treaty’s latest negotiation in Geneva ended in another deadlock as like-minded oil states pushed for better waste collection and recycling infrastructure for plastics, which are made using fossil fuels, while others advocated for reducing plastic production.\\n",

            "title": "Hong Kong pulls ahead of Singapore in race to attract crypto-treasuries: blockchain expert",
            "description": "Hong Kong has pulled ahead of Singapore in attracting technology-driven companies that use cryptocurrency for treasury management and other applications, reinforcing its position as Asia’s leading digital-asset hub, at least for now, according to a crypto industry veteran who advises both governments.\\n“Over the past two years, especially in the first half of this year, many professionals and companies in the Web3 ecosystem have relocated their headquarters to Hong Kong from Singapore,” said Gu Ronghui, a technology adviser to the Monetary Authority of Singapore and a former member of Hong Kong’s Web3 task force, ahead of the city’s largest-ever FinTech Week, which runs from November 3 to 7.\\nThe shift reflected Hong Kong’s concerted effort to revitalise its cryptocurrency ecosystem.\\nThe city has introduced bank-level regulations for stablecoins, granted licences to virtual-asset trading platforms, and paved the way for qualified institutions to issue Hong Kong’s first batch of stablecoins as early as next year.\\n“Hong Kong seized this timely window to catch up rapidly,” Gu said.\\nGu is also the co-founder of CertiK, a New York-based blockchain-security company whose clients include Ant Group. The firm, which provides life-cycle security and compliance services for Web3 projects and institutional clients, planned to expand its business and headcount in Hong Kong next year and already operated from Cyberport.\\nGu will attend Hong Kong FinTech Week as a speaker.\\n“A growing number of technology-driven companies – particularly data and biotech firms with hybrid digital asset treasury models – will settle in Hong Kong,” he added.\\nUnder a hybrid treasury model, companies run regular cash-generating businesses while also holding digital assets, giving them greater flexibility in managing liquidity and investment.\\nFor example, Fosun-backed Sisram Medical, a Hong Kong-listed Israeli medical-aesthetics company valued at about US$328 million, has tokenised its shares to enable global trading.\\n\\nYunfeng Financial Group, backed by Alibaba Group Holding, said in September it had bought US$44 million worth of ether for its balance-sheet reserves. Alibaba owns the Post.\\nThe use of digital tokens for treasury management among listed companies has gained traction globally.\\nAccording to research by CertiK, corporate crypto holdings worldwide surpassed US$130 billion this year, comprising mainly bitcoin and stablecoins, which are cryptocurrencies pegged to assets such as fiat currencies.\\nDespite their volatility, digital tokens can serve as a hedge against currency devaluation and, for listed companies, could confer a valuation premium by drawing investor interest, Gu said.\\n“Hong Kong is following global capital-market trends and moving fast to keep pace with changes among the world’s big tech companies,” he added, citing Tesla’s 2021 purchase of US$1.5 billion in bitcoin.\\n“Hong Kong’s regulatory approach is clear,” Gu said. “It wants digital assets to link with the real economy and solve practical problems. It does not want risky cycles where firms simply raise capital, hoard tokens, inflate valuations and then raise funds again.”\\nThe Hong Kong government has yet to introduce specific policies covering digital-asset treasuries. However, financial regulators have said that forthcoming stablecoin issuers must be either locally incorporated companies or authorised foreign banks.\\nGu said Hong Kong’s advantages as a crypto hub remained strong. The city could draw on a large pool of software engineers and developers from mainland China while its deep capital markets were able to attract start-ups seeking access to international funding.\\n“As long as Hong Kong keeps investing in compliance and blockchain infrastructure, its advantages will remain obvious,” he added.\\n",

            "description": "Amazon posted higher fiscal third quarter profit and sales compared with a year ago, fuelled by accelerating growth in its cloud computing business and strong spending by its customers looking for low prices at a time when inflation is resurging.\\nThe results, announced Thursday, beat Wall Street expectations. The company’s prominent cloud computing arm also surpassed analysts’ expectations, rising 20 per cent. But Amazon issued a cautious sales outlook for the fiscal fourth quarter.\\nShares, however, soared nearly 13 per cent in after-hours trading.\\nAnalysts are analysing Amazon’s results, along with other retailers’ earnings performances, to get insight into how shoppers are spending heading into the holiday season and how the online behemoth is managing cost increases from President Donald Trump’s tariffs.\\nBut Amazon, based in Seattle, is also under pressure to shore up confidence among investors that its computing arm Amazon Web Services is just as powerful as Microsoft’s Azure and Google’s Google Cloud platform. Amazon delivered better-than-expected 20 per cent growth for AWS, following a 17.5 per cent growth in the fiscal second quarter. Andy Jassy, president and CEO of Amazon, noted in a statement that AWS is growing at a pace it has not seen since 2022.\\nLast week Amazon grappled with a massive outage of AWS after a problem disrupted internet use around the world for most of the day, taking down a broad range of online services, including social media, gaming, food delivery, streaming and financial platforms.\\n\\nJassy also noted Amazon is seeing strong momentum and growth across Amazon as artificial intelligence drives “meaningful improvements in every corner of our business”.\\nAmazon is rapidly automating its warehouses, raising big questions on how many workers it will need in the future.\\nIn fact, Amazon announced on Tuesday that it was cutting about 14,000 corporate jobs as it ramps up spending on artificial intelligence and cuts costs elsewhere.\\nLate last month, Amazon unveiled a new robotics system – being tested in South Carolina – for its warehouses that coordinates multiple arms to perform picking, stowing, and consolidating tasks simultaneously. This technology effectively collapses three assembly lines into one, the company said.\\nAmazon is also testing an AI agent that helps human managers deploy workers and avoid bottlenecks. The system allows operators to spend less time analysing dashboards and more time coaching teams, creating safer work environments, the company said.\\nAmazon posted net income of US$21.12 billion, or US$1.95 per share, for the quarter ended September 30. That is up from US$15.33 billion, or US$1.43 per share, a year ago.\\nAmazon’s sales rose to US$180.2 billion, up from US$158.88 billion in the year-ago period. The number of items that Amazon sold in the latest period increased 11 per cent, the company said.\\nAmazon said it expects sales for the fiscal fourth quarter to be in the range of US$206 billion to US$213 billion.\\n",

            "description": "China’s manufacturing activity remained in contraction for a seventh consecutive month in October, official data shows, as the world’s second-largest economy continues to battle persistent external headwinds and soft domestic demand.\\nThe manufacturing purchasing managers’ index (PMI) stood at 49 in October, down from 49.8 the previous month, according to data released on Friday by the National Bureau of Statistics.\\nThe reading fell short of the 50 projected by economists polled by financial data provider Wind.\\nThe monthly index compiles survey data given by supply chain managers from a variety of sectors. A reading above 50 suggests economic expansion, while one below 50 indicates contraction.\\n“Affected by factors such as the early release of some demand before the National Day holiday and a more complex international environment, manufacturing activity in October slowed down compared to the previous month,” said Huo Lihui, chief statistician of the bureau’s Service Survey Centre, noting that both demand and supply have slowed.\\nThe new orders sub-index – a measure of manufacturing demand – came in at 48.8 in October, down from 49.7 a month earlier. Meanwhile, the production sub-index dropped to 49.7 from 51.9 in September.\\nZhang Zhiwei, chief economist at Pinpoint Asset Management, noted that China’s economic momentum has weakened since the middle of the year.\\n“The property sector slowdown continues to put pressure on domestic demand. The fiscal policy stance has not changed significantly to offset such downward pressure,” he said.\\n“As the trade negotiation went successfully yesterday, I think the macro policy in China will stay unchanged for the rest of this year. I expect fiscal policy will become more proactive in Q1 next year.”\\nChina’s vast manufacturing sector remains a vital source of growth for the country’s economy, and is set to maintain its central role in Beijing’s 15th five-year plan, which outlines the Chinese leadership’s policy priorities for the rest of the decade.\\nBut China’s factories have been weighed down this year by weak domestic demand, vicious price wars and a prolonged trade war with the United States – though output has remained more resilient than many observers predicted.\\nChina’s exports have so far held firm in the face of American tariffs, with front-loading and strong growth in shipments to alternative markets helping to offset a decline in demand from the US.\\nDomestic demand has remained soft despite government efforts to boost consumption, with the eight-day “golden week” public holiday in early October only bringing a modest year-on-year uptick in consumer spending.\\nHowever, there are signs that Beijing’s campaign against price wars and industrial overcapacity is starting to ease pressure on manufacturers. Industrial profits grew 21.6 per cent in September, the fastest pace in nearly two years, the statistics bureau said in a separate release on Monday.\\nAnd a meeting between President Xi Jinping and US President Donald Trump in Busan, South Korea, on Thursday set a tone of de-escalation between the world’s two largest economies.\\nThe US announced that it would lower tariffs on Chinese imports, while China’s Ministry of Commerce stated that its tightened export controls on rare earths would be suspended for one year.\\nChina’s non-manufacturing PMI, which measures activity in the construction and services sectors, rose to 50.1 in October from 50 last month, the bureau’s data showed.\\nChina’s official composite PMI – which tracks both the manufacturing and services sectors – was 50 in October, compared with 50.6 in September.\\nAdditional reporting by Kandy Wong\\n",

Another World\\n\\n\\nThis animated feature contemplates the limits of goodness in the face of great evil, set against a vibrant action fantasy backdrop.\\nAdapted from Naka Saijo’s novel Sennenki: Thousand-Year Journey of an Oni with both narrative flair and visual potency, this impressive effort by first-time director Tommy Ng Kai-chung and writer-producer Polly Yeung Po-man is an anomaly in more ways than one.\\nAlthough the film’s focus on reincarnation appears to align it with Eastern religions, Another World’s belief in kindness renders it a universally engaging watch. Young children should stay away, however, as they might be scarred by some of the shockingly grisly moments in this macabre tale.\\nLeading us into the afterlife is one of its spirit guides, Gudo (voiced by Chung Suet-ying), who is tasked with helping deceased souls let go of their memories and escorting them past a magical waterfall into the next life. His latest charge is a girl who is not aware that she has died. Read our full review\\nAnother World is in cinemas now.\\nFind this useful?

The more turbulent the times, the more we must work together,” he said at a multilateral forum in South Korea.\\nMore to follow...\\n",

            "description": "Hong Kong could issue Islamic bonds to fund the Northern Metropolis megaproject as long as they are a cost-effective option, given the city’s established legal and regulatory framework for such activities under the faith, the finance chief has said.\\nFinancial Secretary Paul Chan Mo-po made the remarks on Thursday as he wrapped up his trip to this year’s Future Investment Initiative forum in Riyadh, where his trade delegation also yielded five memorandums of understanding (MOUs).\\n“The legal and regulatory framework for issuing Islamic bonds is mature. We can proceed at any time [for the Northern Metropolis], provided the market reflects that issuing these instruments is cheaper and yields better results,” he said in an interview with the Post in Riyadh.\\nChan said that the government would review funding options for the scheme, which aims to turn 30,000 hectares (74,132 acres) of land into an engine for economic growth and a housing hub, and would select the most cost-effective method while expediting development.\\nIn the annual budget announced in February last year, Chan said authorities planned to issue HK$95 billion (US$12.2 billion) to HK$135 billion in bonds annually over the next five years to drive the development of the Northern Metropolis and other infrastructure projects.\\nChan stressed on Thursday that Islamic finance was “always a component” of the government’s financial planning.\\nHe also said that, building on the momentum established at last year’s conference, five MOUs had been signed during the trip, with most involving technology firms and Hong Kong’s Trade Development Council (TDC).\\n\\nMaphive Technology CEO John Chan, who is part of the delegation team, expressed positivity about the trip, which culminated in the successful signing of an MOU with a subsidiary of Olayan Saudi Holding Company, part of the hospitality and events sector.\\n“I was able to meet investors during the trip and build up solid connections with some of them,” he said, adding that this was his third visit to Riyadh.\\nThe TDC signed an MOU with the Digital Cooperation Organisation, a multilateral body that focuses on the digital economy. The deal aims to foster collaboration in e-commerce, innovation and inclusive economic growth.\\nThe cooperation would support the participation of micro, small and medium-sized enterprises in TDC trade fairs and business-matching events, the Hong Kong body said.\\nPaul Chan also said Saudi companies showed great interest in utilising Hong Kong as a platform to access the wider Asian market during the meeting with enterprises from the country.\\n“Hong Kong could act as a two-way platform for both Saudi firms and Hong Kong and mainland companies [to interchange and collaborate],” he said.\\nHe further stated that authorities were actively building an ecosystem to suit both parties, pointing to Hong Kong’s launch of Asia’s first exchange-traded fund (ETF) tracking Saudi Arabia’s Islamic government bonds earlier this year.\\nFollowing the ETF launch, market anticipation is high for the first firm from the Middle East to list in Hong Kong.\\nChan noted that the first company could be listed in a few months, citing Dubai-based diaper maker Softcare, which began assessing investor interest in its Hong Kong initial public offering after passing its listing hearing in late October.\\n“I expect that gradually we will see companies from Saudi Arabia come to Hong Kong to list, as the kingdom has a vast number of projects that require capital,” he said.\\nUnder the kingdom’s Vision 2030 plan, Saudi Arabia is aggressively modernising and diversifying its economy to reduce its reliance on oil.\\nSpeaking of forming close ties between Hong Kong and Gulf states, Chan said the authorities were actively progressing with plans to establish an Economic and Trade Office (ETO) in Riyadh, with “significant progress expected in the next few months”.\\nThe government currently operates one ETO in the Middle East, located in Dubai.\\n",
