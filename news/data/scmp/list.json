            "description": "A Malaysian court on Friday sentenced a woman to five years&apos; jail for neglect leading to the death of her six-year-old autistic son, in a case that has shocked the nation and raised questions about the lack of support for families with special needs children.\\nThe body of Zayn Rayyan Abdul Matin was found in a stream near his home in a suburb outside Kuala Lumpur on December 6, 2023, a day after he was reported missing by his parents.\\nAuthorities have speculated that Zayn could have been murdered after an autopsy revealed injuries to his neck and body, which police said were signs of self-defence. Investigators are still investigating the circumstances of his death.\\nOn Friday, Sessions Court Judge Syahliza Warnoh said Zayn’s mother, Ismanira Abdul Manaf, had failed to disprove the prosecution’s case that her negligence had led to physical injury to her son, according to a report by national newswire Bernama.\\nThe crime carries a maximum fine of 50,000 ringgit (US$11,800), up to 20 years&apos; jail or both.\\nIsmanira, 30, was instructed to begin her sentence on Friday.\\n\\n\\nHer case centred on witness accounts that she had let her son roam around their housing block unsupervised on the day that he went missing.\\nPolice also secured transcripts of WhatsApp messages shared between Ismarina and her husband, Zaim Ikhwan Zahari, which included lines of her saying she was “so stressed I could die” and that she had “spanked his bottom” when she was annoyed and angry with Zayn’s behaviour.\\nZaim, also 30, was acquitted of a similar charge in July.\\nThe case has raised widespread concern over the level of support available for families with special needs children, especially when both parents are working, as in the case of Zayn’s family.\\nSocial work experts have called for deeper community involvement to help parents watch out for their special needs children in the aftermath of Zayn’s case, and to shed pervasive social stigmas surrounding mental and physical disabilities.\\nNearly 290,000 students registered in schools across the country were categorised as having either physical or mental disabilities last year, according to government data.\\nOf the figure, over 23,600 were diagnosed with autism, while more than 9,500 suffered from attention deficit hyperactivity disorder.\\n",

            "title": "Canada, Philippines deepen military ties with new joint forces pact amid China concerns",
            "description": "The Philippines and Canada are set to sign a visiting forces agreement, a military cooperation pact that would allow troops from both countries on each other’s soil for joint exercises and other activities amid China’s increasing influence in the region.\\nCanadian Minister of National Defence David McGuinty will be in Manila on Sunday to hold bilateral meetings with Philippine Defence Secretary Gilberto Teodoro Jnr and sign the agreement, according to an advisory released by the Department of National Defence on Wednesday.\\nThe signing of the agreement follows steps by Manila and Ottawa to deepen their security relations since inking a Memorandum of Understanding on Defence Cooperation in January last year.\\nCooperation between both countries “has expanded both in breadth and depth across all areas of defence, especially in maritime security, cybersecurity and capacity building”, according to a statement by the Philippines’ Department of Foreign Affairs in April.\\n\\nAnalysts called the agreement a natural step forward in the deepening security ties between the Philippines and Canada as both countries were concerned about China’s military build-up in the Indo-Pacific region.\\nDon McLain Gill, an international relations lecturer at De La Salle University, told This Week in Asia that the agreement allowed both countries to efficiently deploy troops and circumvent the bureaucratic delays that come with joint military exercises.\\n“The [agreement] would streamline military-to-military cooperation with the Philippines, and this would in fact reiterate and reinforce the 2024 memorandum of understanding,” the geopolitical analyst said.\\nJulio Amador, the interim president of the Foundation for the National Interest and founder and trustee of the non-profit policy advisory firm FACTS Asia, called the agreement the “next step”.\\nIt creates a legal framework for ramping up military-to-military activities – including the annual Balikatan exercises with the US – which will benefit the Philippines’ armed forces and increase operability with Canada’s troops, according to him.\\n“A visiting forces agreement with Canada strengthens the Philippines’ network of partners on defence and military issues, and indicates that diplomatic and military cooperation is increasing and deepening,” he said.\\n\\n\\nAmador added that the agreement added to the Philippines’ potential deterrence strategy and showed that the country was “beginning to move beyond just exposing China’s belligerent behaviour”.\\n“When looking at the strategic environment from the South China Sea to the cross-straits, the [agreement] creates a partnership between the two countries that hints at alignment on how to respond to a China that is becoming more confident in flexing its muscles,” Amador said.\\nAway from Washington’s shadow\\nAnalysts say that the defence pact comes amid a fundamentally changed strategic environment, with the deal providing mutual benefits for both countries – particularly as Canada moves away from the shadow of the US in the region.\\n“When it comes to the security threats that the Philippines is facing, adding more defence partners is a critical component of, hopefully, a bigger strategy than what we are currently seeing right now,” Amador said.\\n“The [agreement} is an indication that the Philippines is actively identifying like-minded partners as it responds to a strategic environment that has fundamentally changed.”\\nMeanwhile, Gill called the Philippines “a natural partner for Canada” and one of the North American country’s anchors in its Indo-Pacific strategy, which it launched in 2022. Ottawa has committed C$2.3 billion (US$1.6 billion) over five years to developing its security engagement in the region.\\n\\nChester Cabalza, founder and president of the think tank International Development Security and Cooperation, said that the “Philippines’ like-minded friends” such as Canada were “all in a hurry to strike a defence deal while the iron is hot”.\\n“Both Ottawa and Manila are enjoying the momentum as Canadians and Filipinos lead the marathon on international rules-based order,” he said.\\nCabalza pointed out that the Philippines has benefited from Canada’s satellite-powered dark vessel detection programme used in the West Philippine Sea, Manila’s exclusive economic zone within the South China Sea, to detect ships from the China Coast Guard and maritime militia that have “gone dark” or turned off their automatic identification system trackers.\\nCanada had “made a name for itself as a trusted, functional security partner of the Philippines”, Gill said.\\n“Our security relationship with Ottawa took off in a relatively short amount of time. Within just two years, we were able to accomplish so much in terms of broadening and deepening our security partnership,” he said, referring to the dark vessel detection programme support and the joint sail activities between both countries.\\nHowever, Gill added that naval exercises should not be the primary cornerstone of the security partnership between both countries, and stressed that other areas should be highlighted and leveraged, such as cyber defence.\\n“Canada has a very robust experience in cyber defence and the cybersecurity threats that the Philippines continues to ... face on a daily basis. Canada is a natural partner in this regard, and I think that we have much to tap and maximise when it comes to our cybersecurity cooperation,” he said.\\n\\nShipbuilding was another strong point for the partnership, Gill said, adding that Canada could play a role in the imparting of technology, technical cooperation, and skills-building as Manila looks to strengthen its shipbuilding capabilities.\\nMeanwhile, Manila can serve as a gateway for Ottawa to further deepen its engagement in the region, with the Philippines seen as “one of the success stories of Canada’s Indo-Pacific strategy”, Gill said.\\n“By improving its security relations to the Philippines, this could eventually be a stepping stone for other countries in the region. We’ve seen Canada and Indonesia sign their first-ever bilateral free trade agreement,” he said.\\n“So we see how Canada has also been perceived more positively in the region, away from the common misconception that Canada is basically just a reflection or shadow of the US strategy in the Indo-Pacific. Canada has clearly shown great agency, and this is something that would benefit its objectives in the region as it seeks to diversify its security and economic partners as well.”\\n",

            "title": "Fate of thousands feared in Sudan’s Darfur after reported rampage by paramilitaries",
            "description": "Sudanese fleeing a paramilitary force that seized a city in the country’s Darfur region trickled into a nearby refugee camp on Thursday after walking for miles, telling aid workers that roads were littered with bodies. Aid groups feared for the fate of thousands more trying to escape, with hundreds reportedly killed in the turmoil.\\nThe UN Security Council convened an emergency meeting on Sudan amid international alarm over the bloodshed. UN officials have warned of a rampage by the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces after it took over the city of El-Fasher, reportedly killing more than 450 people in a hospital and carrying out ethnically targeted killings of civilians and sexual assaults.\\nSpeaking at the meeting, UN humanitarian chief Tom Fletcher criticised the Security Council for not acting sooner in Sudan. The country has been torn for the past two years by a war between the military and the RSF that has killed more than 40,000 people and left more than 14 million displaced.\\n“Can anyone here say we did not know this was coming?” he said. “We cannot hear the screams, but as we sit here today the horror is continuing. Women and girls are being raped, people being mutilated and killed with utter impunity.”\\n\\nAs the US and others at the gathering called for an end to “external support” for the warring parties, Sudan’s representative accused the United Arab Emirates, a top American ally, of backing the RSF. The Gulf nation has denied reports it provides weapons and funding to the paramilitary forces. A UN panel of experts in 2024 said it found the reports credible.\\nThe RSF had been besieging El-Fasher, the last military-held stronghold in the Darfur region, for the past 500 days. Its capture raised fears that Africa’s third-largest nation may split, with the paramilitaries holding Darfur and the military holding the capital Khartoum and the north and east of the country.\\nThe UN migration agency said over 36,000 have reportedly fled El-Fasher since Sunday, with people fleeing on foot in the middle of the night. Experts analysing satellite imagery say an earthen wall built by the RSF around the city was preventing residents from fleeing and has become a “kill box” where some appear to have been shot.\\nOnly thousands have arrived at Tawila, a town some 60km (35 miles) west of El-Fasher. Tawila has already burgeoned into a sprawling refugee camp housing hundreds of thousands who fled the RSF’s siege of El-Fasher over the past year.\\nMathilde Vu, advocacy manager for the Norwegian Refugee Council, which manages the camp, said the small number reaching Tawila “should be a concern for all of us … That tells the horror of the journey”.\\nThe new arrivals told aid workers that there were arbitrary killings by RSF along the roads, which were littered with bodies, the International Rescue Committee said. Save the Children said arriving women described hiding with their children in trenches or abandoned buildings inside El-Fasher to escape fighters, then being attacked and robbed by armed men as they left the city.\\n\\nVu said the vast majority of those arriving in Tawila were women, or families headed by women, as well as large numbers of children separated from their parents. Some among the arrivals were injured, many were malnourished.\\nSome women reported rapes as they fled, Vu said.\\n“Men are just not arriving. Either they were killed, disappeared or lost along the way,” she said.\\nIn Tawila, the newly displaced sheltered under trees. One woman, Aisha Ismael, said she arrived barefoot with none of her belongings amid constant drone attacks and shelling. People foraged for livestock fodder known as ambaz, which is made from peanut shells and water, because they were so hungry.\\n“We looked for it in the dirt to eat and they didn’t even let us. If they catch us, they hit us and throw it away,” she said.\\nDisrupted communications around El-Fasher has made assessing the devastation inside the city difficult. Witnesses told Associated Press that RSF fighters went from house to house, beating and shooting people, including women and children.\\n\\n🚨HUMAN SECURITY EMERGENCY🚨\\nDay 2: RSF continues mass killings in El Fasher: @HRL_YaleSPH finds evidence of mass killings at RSF-controlled former Children’s Hospital, Saudi Hospital and along the berm.#KeepEyesOnSudan\\n🛰️@AirbusSpace @Maxarhttps://t.co/1HApllgNL5 pic.twitter.com/g9KmBLhjH0\\n— Humanitarian Research Lab (HRL) at YSPH (@HRL_YaleSPH) October 29, 2025\\n\\nSome 460 patients and their companions were reportedly killed on Tuesday at the Saudi Hospital in El-Fasher, said Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the director general of the World Health Organization.\\nThe RSF on Thursday denied carrying out killings at the hospital. It said it had arrested a number of individuals accused of committing violations during the seizure of El-Fasher.\\nThe Yale School of Public Health’s Humanitarian Research Lab said satellite imagery from Airbus corroborated alleged killings by the RSF around the Saudi Hospital. It also analysed images of a children’s hospital that the RSF turned into a detention centre months ago and found “a pile consistent with human remains” in the yard.\\n“We think those are people who were killed at the detention centre,” the lab’s executive director Nathaniel Raymond said.\\nThe Yale researchers also said that “systematic killings” took place in the vicinity of the earthen wall, which the RSF built outside the city earlier this year.\\n“The entire city is surrounded by a berm. It is a kill box, to trap them, to kill them,” said Raymond.\\n\\nAt the Security Council gathering, US ambassador to the UN Dorothy Shea condemned “the horrific violence occurring in El-Fasher”. She repeated Washington’s stance that the RSF and its allied militias have committed genocide in Sudan.\\nShe said American officials are working to secure “an immediate humanitarian truce and halting external support” for the violence in Sudan.\\nThe military - which opponents say is linked to Sudanese Islamist groups - and the RSF were previously allies in ruling Sudan, until they fell out in a struggle for power in 2003. Both sides have faced allegations of human rights abuses.\\nBut rights groups and the United Nations have accused the RSF and allied Arab militias of repeated mass killings of civilians and widespread rapes, mainly targeting non-Arab communities. The RSF is largely made up of fighters from the Janjaweed militia that committed genocide in the early 2000s in Darfur.\\nEgypt, where the military dominates the government, gives political backing to the Sudanese military, seeing it as a more reliable ally in the neighbouring nation.\\nThe UAE is reported to back the RSF, similar to its support of armed factions in Libya and Yemen to spread its influence and combat Islamist groups. It has repeatedly denied allegations that it funnels weapons to the RSF. But in January 2024, the UN-appointed Panel of Experts for Sudan detailed reports of cargo planes believed to carry weapons destined for the RSF through neighbouring Chad and called the reports credible.\\nDuring Thursday’s session, the UAE’s representative to the UN, Mohamed Abushahab, said the Gulf state stands in “solidarity” with the Sudanese people and announced US$100 million in humanitarian aid.\\nSudan’s UN ambassador Al-Harith Idriss Al-Harith Mohamed accused the UAE of waging a “war of aggression” in Sudan with its support of the RSF and criticised the Security Council for failing to take “any practical measures to hold this particular sponsor and others accountable”.\\n",

He would not irritate other people so much if the parents properly disciplined their children when they behaved badly.”\\nA third person said: “If he wanted to see Mount Fuji, he should have gone to the deck.”\\nThe post-pandemic tourism in Japan surged, as the country saw 36.9 million foreign tourists last year, surpassing the previous record of 31.9 million in 2019.\\nAs a result, discussions about overtourism and manners have risen.\\nIn 2024 and 2025, barriers were erected two times in front of a convenience shop in Fujikawaguchiko town.\\n\\nThe shop became famous among tourists as it appears to be sitting right at the foot of Mount Fuji.

            "description": "A Japanese atomic bomb survivors group that won the Nobel Peace Prize has strongly criticised US President Donald Trump’s surprise directive to begin nuclear weapons testing, calling it “utterly unacceptable”.\\nMore than 200,000 people were killed when the United States dropped two atomic bombs on Japan’s Hiroshima and Nagasaki during World War II, the only time nuclear weapons have been used during warfare.\\nSurvivors, known as hibakusha, have battled decades of physical and psychological trauma as well as the stigma that often came with being a victim.\\nAfter Trump said on Thursday that he had ordered the Pentagon to start nuclear weapons testing to equal China and Russia, Nobel laureate Nihon Hidankyo sent a letter of protest to the US embassy in Japan.\\nThe directive “directly contradicts the efforts by nations around the world striving for a peaceful world without nuclear weapons and is utterly unacceptable”, the survivors group said in the letter, a copy of which was obtained by Agence France-Presse on Friday.\\nThe mayor of Nagasaki also condemned Trump’s order, saying it “trampled on the efforts of people around the world who have been sweating blood and tears to realise a world without nuclear weapons”.\\n“If nuclear weapons testing were to start immediately, wouldn’t that make him unworthy of the Nobel Peace Prize?” Mayor Shiro Suzuki told reporters on Thursday, referring to Japanese Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi’s intention to nominate Trump for the award.\\n\\n\\nHidankyo, a grass roots movement of hibakusha, won the Nobel Peace Prize in 2024, and while accepting the prize, called on countries to abolish nuclear weapons.\\nTwo other atomic bomb survivor groups based in Hiroshima issued statements of protest, saying: “We strongly protest and firmly demand that no such experiments be conducted.”\\n“In a nuclear war, there are no winners or losers; all of humanity becomes the loser,” said Hiroshima Congress against A-and-H Bombs (Hiroshima Gensuikin) and the Hiroshima prefecture Federation of A-Bomb Victims Associations in a joint statement, which was also sent to the US embassy in Japan.\\n“The inhumane nature of nuclear weapons is evident from the devastation witnessed in Hiroshima and Nagasaki,” it added.\\nThe US dropped an atomic bomb on Hiroshima on August 6, 1945, and then another on Nagasaki three days later. Shortly afterwards, Japan surrendered, ending World War II.\\nAround 140,000 people died in Hiroshima and about 74,000 others in Nagasaki, including many from the effects of radiation exposure.\\nTrump’s announcement on nuclear testing left much unanswered – chiefly about whether he meant testing weapons systems or actually conducting test explosions, something the US has not done since 1992.\\nTakaichi, Japan’s first woman prime minister, this week announced she would nominate Trump for a Nobel Peace Prize as she lavished the US leader with praise during his visit to Tokyo.\\n",

            "title": "Wada launches ‘Operation Puncture’ to probe leak about Chinese swimmers’ doping tests",
            "description": "The World Anti-Doping Agency confirmed on Thursday it was looking into a leak about an investigation that resulted in the agency clearing 23 Chinese swimmers who tested positive for a banned heart medication before the Tokyo Olympics in 2021.\\nThe agency has defended its decision to clear the swimmers of doping. It said it had agreed with Chinese anti-doping authorities who found the swimmers’ samples were contaminated.\\nThe existence of the investigation by China and Wada had been kept under wraps before the New York Times and German broadcaster ARD reported on it last year.\\nARD reported on Wednesday that the agency was looking for the person who tipped off the news media about the investigation. The move is unusual because Wada encourages and relies on whistle-blowers to root out doping.\\nGünter Younger, director of intelligence and investigations at Wada, confirmed it had launched Operation Puncture to learn about the leak, but denied it was looking for the person who blew the whistle.\\n\\n“We’re not chasing the whistle-blower,” Younger told reporters at a media event in London. “What we want to try to find out is how the leak happened and what was the motivation of the leak.”\\nYounger touted the agency’s strong whistle-blower protections and said it was policy not to reveal ongoing investigations to protect those who may unfairly be accused of drug use.\\nHe said he believed the leak was politically motivated and he wanted to prevent that from happening again, but would not do anything to endanger the whistle-blower.\\nThe Chinese swimming case has been a flashpoint of controversy in sport and Wada has been criticised by athletes, sports governing bodies and groups dedicated to fighting the use of performance-enhancing drugs.\\nAmong the biggest critics have been anti-doping and government leaders in the United States, where the government has refused to pay its annual dues to Wada worth more than US$3.6 million.\\n",

            "title": "Thailand’s million-dollar gold heist reveals costly price of peace in insurgency-hit south",
            "description": "A million-dollar gold heist in Thailand’s far south by armed robbers who blocked roads with spikes and set explosives to seal their escape across the Malaysian border has rattled the Thai security establishment, as efforts to reignite peace talks in an area roiled by insurgency continue to fall flat.\\nAround 20 men working in three teams carried out the October 5 theft from a gold shop in Sungai Kolok, bordering Malaysia’s Kelantan State.\\nThe theft of hundreds of gold ornaments and jewellery valued at 35 million baht (US$1.08 million) came as prices for the precious metal spiked to historic highs of over US$4,200 per 28 grams (one ounce) earlier this month.\\nUsing two stolen getaway trucks, the robbers planted road spikes and explosives to obstruct police pursuit in a heist so well oiled that Thai authorities immediately attributed it to the Barisan Revolusi Nasional Melayu Patani (BRN).\\n\\nTwo days after the hold-up, Defence Minister Nattaphon Narkphanit said the alleged BRN operatives had already smuggled the gold out of Thailand and that efforts to recover it would require “cross-border cooperation”, without naming Malaysia specifically.\\nThe BRN is the primary separatist movement controlling combatants in Thailand’s Malay-Muslim majority south.\\nA shadowy, underground movement, the BRN has led the rebellion against control by Bangkok. It accuses the Thai state of widespread abuses and of railroading the south’s unique Malay culture as well as trying to tip the demographic balance away from the Muslim population by moving in Buddhist settlers from the poor northeast of the country.\\nThe BRN typically neither confirms nor denies involvement in violent or criminal incidents, but its cells have in the past been accused of targeting civilians.\\nViolence as resistance\\nThe gold heist follows a spike in violence this year, including 88 deaths linked to the rebellion, according to conflict monitor Deep South Watch.\\n“The violence is a form of resistance; even the recent gold heist needs to be understood in those terms,” Asmadee Bueraheng, a Pattani-based writer and long-time conflict observer, told This Week in Asia.\\n“BRN combatants are protesting the Thai economic system, which they see as unfair, the policy of assimilation, which Malay Muslims reject because it comes at the expense of their religious identity, and the government’s transmigration policy, which they see as outside settlers occupying and taking away their land.”\\nAn insurgency has blistered across Thailand’s southernmost provinces for over two decades, claiming more than 7,700 lives. Many of those killed were civilians caught in shootings and bomb attacks by rebels as well as assaults by Thai forces.\\nThe BRN has been engaging in on-again, off-again peace talks to the Thai government since 2013. Mediated by Malaysia, the discussions have sputtered. Successive Thai governments have shown little political will to resolve the conflict as concessions to the Malays of Patani are deemed costly politically.\\n\\nAfter decades of grinding stalemate, the BRN’s current leadership has shown a willingness to compromise. Three years ago, the group agreed to negotiate under the terms of the Thai constitution, which explicitly states the country is “inseparable”. This apparent softening of its stance for a separate state makes it easier for talks to take place.\\n“Ultimately, we aim to establish a power-sharing system that guarantees justice, autonomy and recognition of Patani’s distinct identity,” the spokesman for the BRN’s negotiation team, Nikmatulla bin Seri said, using the Malay spelling for the kingdom colonised by Thailand over a century ago.\\nBut talks are often undercut by violence that, once unleashed, takes on a dynamic of its own.\\nIn April, Thai security forces killed senior BRN member Abdulroning Lateh, a battle-hardened 60-year-old who helped nurture the current generation of combatants that resurfaced in January 2004. In response, his followers hit civilian and military targets, culminating in the May 2 killing of four civilians, including a nine-year-old girl and a 76-year-old blind woman in Narathiwat province.\\nThe violence also threatens to spill outside the confines of the south. On June 11, improvised explosive devices were found in Krabi and Phuket – two of Thailand’s top tourist destinations. Their locations were revealed by two suspected BRN operatives who confessed to planting them after they were caught.\\nInstability in Bangkok\\nThe lack of concrete progress on peace has been made worse by chronic instability in Bangkok, which has had three prime ministers in as many years. A potential election early next year is set to bring yet another government.\\nAfter the fall of successive Thai governments under Thaksin Shinawatra’s Pheu Thai party, hopes for peace talks to résumé and a political deal to the conflict have receded.\\nThe new short-term government of Prime Minister Anutin Charnvirakul has appointed a new chief negotiator for the deep south process, despite his government’s curtailed four-month tenure.\\nRetired general Somsak Rungsita, a former secretary general of the National Security Council, will lead the Malaysia-mediated talks.\\n\\n\\nHis task is urgent. If peace cannot be struck soon, future BRN leaders may be less accommodating, warns Artef Sokho of The Patani, a peace advocacy group which sometimes acts as a go-between with the rebels and the Thai side.\\n“BRN elders command a great deal of respect from their people,” he said. “Right now, they are willing to negotiate for a fair deal. But if and when these ageing leaders step down or pass away, I’m not so sure the next generation of leaders will be as accommodating.”\\nThai security chiefs have raised the prospect of reintroducing an emergency decree on swathes of the restive south, where it had been lifted as a confidence-building measure. Most of the region remains smothered under martial law and an emergency decree, permitting 30-day detentions without legal representation, which civil society groups say allows the state to round up civilians – including political activists – without charge or cause.\\nUntil those draconian powers are dropped, it will be impossible to negotiate, irrespective of who leads the Bangkok administration, conflict monitors warn.\\n“Setting up a team for the peace talks, along with bringing in an outsider to command over this region, is meaningless because these controversial laws and harassments are still in place,” Asmadee said.\\n",
