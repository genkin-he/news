            "description": "Israel said Thursday that it had identified the remains of hostages Amiram Kuper and Sahar Baruch, whose bodies were returned by Hamas earlier in the day.\\nA statement from Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s office said the families of the deceased men had been informed after “completion of the identification process by the National Institute of Forensic Medicine”.\\nMilitants took 251 people hostage during Hamas’s attack on Israel on October 7, 2023, which triggered the war in Gaza.\\nSahar Baruch was taken from kibbutz Beeri to Gaza and killed during a failed army rescue operation two months later. He was 25 when he died.\\nAmiram Kuper, 84 at the time of his abduction, was kidnapped with his wife Nourit Kuper from their home in kibbutz Nir Oz. Israel announced his death in captivity in June 2024.\\nMilitants have so far returned the remains of 17 of the 28 deceased hostages that Hamas had agreed to hand over as part of a US-brokered truce deal with Israel.\\n\\nIn a statement, the Hostages and Missing Families Forum, a campaign group, expressed its support for the families of Kuper and Baruch, and called for the return of the bodies of the remaining dead hostages.\\nIsrael launched a wave of strikes on Gaza overnight from Tuesday to Wednesday after an attack that left an Israeli soldier dead in the south of the Palestinian territory.\\nGaza’s civil defence agency, which operates as a rescue force under Hamas authority, said the strikes killed more than 100 people, including dozens of children, in the worst night of bombing since the truce went into effect on October 10.\\nBy Wednesday morning, Israel said it had begun “renewed enforcement of the ceasefire”, and both US President Donald Trump and regional mediator Qatar said they expected it to hold.\\nHamas has said its fighters had “no connection to the shooting incident in Rafah” and reaffirmed its commitment to the truce.\\nIt also delayed handing over what it said were the remains of a deceased hostage, adding that any “escalation will hinder the search, excavation and recovery of the bodies”.\\nThe militant group drew outrage in Israel on Monday after it returned the partial remains of a previously recovered captive, which Israel said was a breach of the truce.\\nHamas had said the remains were the 16th body it had agreed to return, but Israeli forensic examination determined they were in fact partial remains of a hostage whose body had already been brought back to Israel around two years ago, according to the prime minister’s office.\\nAfter the start of this month’s ceasefire, the group returned the 20 surviving captives still in its custody and began the process of returning the bodies of the dead hostages.\\nIsrael accuses Hamas of reneging on the deal by not returning them quickly enough, but the Palestinian group says it will take time to locate remains buried in Gaza’s ruins.\\n",

            "title": "Xi-Trump summit breakthroughs are a net positive for China",
            "description": "Relations between the world’s two biggest economies urgently need to be stabilised. Not for the first time has it taken a face-to-face meeting between leaders to try to keep them on track. Thursday’s summit in South Korea between Chinese President Xi Jinping and US President Donald Trump reins in a sustained escalation of trade and political tensions. They made breakthroughs on some thorny bilateral issues.\\n“We have a deal,” Trump proclaimed afterwards. The world will be relieved if the deal clears the way for a more stable, predictable geopolitical environment. It has to be welcomed as a significant breakthrough, considering how fraught relations have become under the Trump administration’s escalation of the trade war with tariffs and tech export curbs.\\nOverall, the summit is a positive result for China that meets realistic expectations, given the deep and structural bilateral issues. Trump has backed down again from his threat of 100 per cent additional tariffs on China over curbs on rare earth exports, which removes a big source of uncertainty and potential risk for markets.\\nA tariff intended to combat fentanyl trafficking to the United States will be reduced from 20 to 10 per cent; this includes Hong Kong and Macau. On other issues, such as shipping and port restrictions, they agreed to suspend the measures for a year – a truce that could help cooler heads prevail. The language on US chip exports and Chinese rare earth exports is vague – it is not surprising that such complex issues cannot be quickly resolved.\\nTrump finalised his proposed visit to Beijing in April. This is very important. He probably will want to wait until then to reveal more deals – if the two sides can reach them. Hopefully, it means that until April there will be political will on both sides to keep things stable.\\nTaiwan was not mentioned, at least in public. That is good for Beijing, which is under no illusion that the US and Western countries will support it over Taiwan. The best it can hope for is that they will largely leave the Taiwan issue to Beijing, to be treated as China’s own affair. In the past, the US president mentioned Taiwan partly as a political gesture and partly as an example for other Western countries. Now, if Trump drops the topic – at least in public – it will make it harder for other Western countries to raise it with Beijing. That is a plus for China.\\nGiven Trump’s style and capacity for backflipping, it may not be plain sailing ahead for bilateral relations. Ultimately, both sides stand to win by keeping ties cordial. Xi echoed this sentiment, according to Xinhua, with his remark to Trump that China and the US should focus on the long-term benefits of cooperation, not get “caught in a vicious cycle of mutual retaliation”.\\n",

More than an hour and a half later, they emerged from their first face-to-face encounter in six years with the same genial manner.\\n5. China’s US soybean buys bring relief to farmers, but permanent deal elusive\\n\\nWhile China’s resumption of US soybean purchases has brought relief to American farmers – who spent months worried their largest buyer may never return – analysts said they expected the trade of agricultural products to become a regular part of bilateral negotiations in the coming years.\\n6. After Xi-Trump talks, lack of semiconductor deal seen as tech-independence issue\\nAmid the apparent absence of a concrete deal being reached with Washington on one of Beijing’s long-standing points of trade contention – export controls on the most advanced semiconductors – analysts say it reflects China’s increasing resolve to become more independent from the US.\\n7. Netherlands faces pressure to surrender control of Nexperia after Xi-Trump summit\\nThe Dutch government is under renewed pressure to end its seizure of the Chinese-owned, Netherlands-based semiconductor company Nexperia, after Washington agreed to suspend its updated export control rule for one year.\\n8. Trump-Xi meeting closer to truce than durable peace, China seen looking stronger\\nAfter months of threats, chest-thumping and uncertainty, the world breathed a collective sigh of relief on Thursday after a meeting between Trump and Xi teased at least temporary relief on a host of bilateral trade irritants.\\n\\n\\n9. Xi-Trump summit yields wins for both China and US despite lack of breakthroughs\\nThe first in-person summit between Chinese and American leaders since Trump’s return to office marked a symbolic reset in the balance of power between the two rivals, yielding a time-bound agreement to pause escalation in their intensifying trade conflict.\\n10.

            "title": "US judge blasts ‘political game’ over shutdown pause on food aid",
            "description": "A federal judge in Boston signalled she may rule that the Trump administration is likely to have violated US law in suspending food-aid benefits to millions of low-income US households during the government shutdown, and she criticised the “political game” being played with American lives.\\nAt a court hearing on Thursday, US District Judge Indira Talwani heard arguments in a lawsuit brought by more than two dozen Democratic-led states seeking to keep federal dollars flowing to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Programme, or Snap.\\nThe judge said she would issue a ruling later in the day.\\nThe US Department of Agriculture previously announced it would halt the programme starting in November until Congress approves a new spending deal. Earlier this month, officials had directed states to stop taking steps to administer the programme ahead of November 1.\\nTalwani bristled at claims by the federal government that it could not tap available emergency funds and that even providing partial payments would be “devastating” and too difficult for states to carry out.\\nThe judge said Congress was trying “to protect the American people,” at a Thursday hearing weighing a request by a coalition of states to force the government to use the emergency funds.\\n“What Congress was trying to do is, if you don’t have enough money, we’ll tighten our belt,” the judge said, not jeopardise people’s well-being because of a “political game”.\\n\\nThe Agriculture Department, which manages the Snap programme, sees those funds as legally unavailable during the shutdown. The US Justice Department lawyer representing the agency went further in court, telling the judge that the agency would probably not access the emergency reserves even if it were legally able to do so.\\n“The agency’s conclusion would likely be that the partial reimbursement would be so disastrous,” said Jason Altabet of DOJ’s civil division, raising concerns that decades-old computer systems could freeze if recalculations are ordered.\\n“They’d conclude the partial reimbursement would be so devastating as to not exercise discretion to do so.”\\nThe court pressed the parties on whether it has the power to issue a nationwide order, noting the Supreme Court’s recent limitations on nationwide injunctions. As such, the lawsuit only sought Snap funds for people in the 25 states and the District of Columbia that filed the legal action.\\nTalwani said she “can’t consider this in terms of only half the nation”.\\nCiting federal law and regulations that appear to anticipate reductions of benefits in some situations, Talwani asked why the government has taken the position that a partial payment with limited emergency funds is “simply too complicated”.\\nA suspension of benefits will exacerbate food insecurity across the country, on top of the strain already facing the millions of federal workers who have not received pay cheques since the shutdown began on October 1.\\nMore than 42 million people in 22 million households nationwide receive Snap benefits, according to government data.\\n\\nThe federal government sends Snap funds to states to administer to eligible residents, who receive the money each month via a benefits card they can use to pay for groceries, similar to a bank debit card.\\nThe lawsuit centres on Snap contingency funds that Congress approved long before the shutdown started on October 1. According to government court filings, there is US$5.25 billion in that reserve fund.\\nCongress also designated money for child nutrition programme,es from the proceeds of import tariffs that the states say also could be used. The administration recently transferred US$300 million from that fund to keep the Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) programme running during the shutdown.\\nThe Agriculture Department has maintained that it can only use the contingency money to “supplement” existing funds that Congress approved to pay for Snap benefits in a specific financial year.\\nThe reserve money is not available now that there are no longer funds left from the previous financial year, the government argues.\\nThe Democratic officials contend the government must exhaust available funding sources before halting payments for a programme that Congress deemed mandatory.\\nThey said the government’s stance conflicts with guidance that the department published before the shutdown stating that the reserve funds would be available to keep the programme running.\\nSeparate from the Boston case, a coalition of non-profit organisations and city officials from across the country filed a new lawsuit in federal court on Thursday contesting the Snap suspension in Providence, Rhode Island. They also asked a judge to immediately enter a temporary restraining order that restores the benefits for November.\\nAlthough Republicans control both chambers of Congress, they need support from several Democrats to clear procedural hurdles in the Senate and pass a new spending bill. Most Senate Democrats have been united in pressing for a budget deal to include a renewal of expiring health insurance subsidies.\\n",

            "title": "How Hong Kong schools are taking a holistic approach to student assessment",
            "description": "You’ve visited campuses, spoken to teachers, reviewed the curriculum and extracurriculars, and are happy with the academic results. You feel good about the community and have finally chosen the right school for your young child. Congratulations! The hardest part is over.\\nNow for the next step: understanding the admissions assessment. Sometimes this is straightforward, but it can just as easily be an impenetrable fog. Phrases like “social-emotional development skills”, “numeracy, cognitive skills, interpersonal abilities”, “non-verbal and quantitative reasoning”, and “an ability to engage” don’t seem as clear-cut as grades or GPAs.\\nThis shift from purely academic metrics to a more holistic evaluation is intentional. Schools aren’t trying to be obscure. They are trying to get a more complete picture of your child. So how can you navigate this process without getting lost in the jargon?\\nWhy holistic assessments?\\n\\nAccording to Joanne Stanley, director of admissions at French International School, parents shouldn’t get bogged down in defining every term. “These are ways of describing observable learning behaviours, rather than just focusing on test scores,” she says.\\nWhile each school has its own methods, few international schools in Hong Kong rely solely on academics. Non-exam formats are now preferred because they allow educators to evaluate a child’s broader potential, including cognitive abilities like problem-solving and social-emotional skills like cooperation.\\n“This ensures that we’re not just looking at isolated data points, but rather understanding the child as a whole learner and community member,” explains Emily Pong, director of admissions at Canadian International School Hong Kong (CDNIS).\\n\\nThis approach isn’t just for young children. For older students, these same skills are woven into interviews and conversations.\\n“We observe social-emotional and cognitive abilities through structured dialogue and problem solving,” explains Carol Wong, director of admissions and marketing at American School Hong Kong (ASHK). “For instance, we might present a student with a complex, open-ended question or a hypothetical scenario. During the conversation, we observe not just what they answer, but how they think. We look for their ability to articulate a logical thought process, consider different perspectives, adapt their thinking based on new information and demonstrate intellectual curiosity by asking insightful questions.”\\nCommon misconceptions\\n\\nMisconceptions around assessments abound. According to Maria Gebrial, head of prep at Malvern College Hong Kong, the biggest mistake is thinking that the process is purely an academic competition. She cautions against parents coaching their child for assessments, emphasising that, “We are building a community, not just selecting pupils with the highest test scores.”\\n“I always encourage parents to take a step back and see the admissions process as a conversation,” she continues. “We are not judging their child; we are exploring whether our school can be the best fit for their unique talents and interests. Every child has something special to offer, and our job is to see that potential.”\\nThis spirit of cooperation is vital. Charlie Beard, director of learning at International College Hong Kong, notes that honesty about expectations from both sides “enhances the likelihood of finding a suitable environment that supports a child’s growth and success”.\\nEnsuring fairness and objectivity\\n\\nWith terms like “engagement” and “interpersonal abilities”, it’s natural to worry about subjectivity. After all, such terms are not as concrete as a maths problem’s single correct answer. They are complex, multifaceted concepts with no universally agreed-on definition, making it hard to create a test that reliably measures them. So how can schools ensure fairness without a single right answer?\\nEducators stress that holistic analysis is just one part of a multilayered process. Gebrial describes Malvern’s style of assessment as “like putting together a puzzle” – one where non-verbal and quantitative reasoning are just some of the pieces.\\nDuring the conversation, we observe not just what they answer, but how they think\\nCarol Wong, American School Hong Kong\\nSimilarly, Pong says CDNIS relies on “multiple data sources, including teacher recommendations and school reports, to ensure our decisions are balanced and fair”. Meanwhile, Wong explains that at ASHK, “To mitigate unconscious bias, we have standardised rubrics for scoring specific, observable competencies rather than subjective personality traits.”\\nFor globetrotting families – a majority of those considering an international school in Hong Kong – cultural fairness is also a key consideration. Unsurprisingly, the city’s international educators are well aware of this potential issue.\\n“Professional development for educators is key to maintaining cultural fairness in assessments,” says Beard. “Engaging in training focused on cultural competence and inclusive pedagogy enables our educators to recognise their own biases and understand how these might impact assessment design.”\\nWhatever your worries as a parent, Pong’s advice is to help your child feel relaxed and allow them to be themselves at the assessment.\\n“Children perform best when they feel safe and supported, so we encourage families to avoid over-preparing or rehearsing responses,” she says. “A genuine interaction tells us far more than a scripted one.”\\n",

            "title": "The quiet US-China tech contest for the future",
            "description": "Power shifts begin in places most people never see – on assembly lines making batteries and robots, along transmission lines feeding data centre clusters, in local offices selling land and in labs training artificial intelligence models. The United States and China are using these quiet levers to construct different futures.\\nThe contest will be decided not by slogans but by who builds the most productive, trusted and durable infrastructure. Those choices will shape billions of lives.\\nThe global supply chain for clean technologies shows why. China dominates solar manufacturing, from raw materials to finished panels. Its share at every stage of the process exceeds 80 per cent. Years of credit, industrial policy and scale have pushed costs so low that solar expansion elsewhere pretty much depends on Chinese exports.\\nElectric vehicles show a similar pattern: China sells most of them. EVs make up a much larger share of its car market than in the US. These strengths give China leverage in pricing, innovation and standards.\\nThis is amplified by automation. In 2024, nearly three-quarters of all industrial robots were installed in Asia. China installed more than the rest of the world combined. Robots help offset a workforce shortage. China is also turning manufacturing muscle into scientific momentum: its researchers produce as many artificial intelligence (AI) papers as the US, Britain and European Union combined, capture a large share of global citation attention and file far more AI-related patents.\\nYet, the US still dominates the frontier: its private investment in AI dwarfs China’s. American companies also produce most of the top-performing models. Scale on one side and cutting-edge innovation on the other define this competition.\\n\\n\\nChina is weaving AI into daily life. Cities such as Shenzhen are testing electric vertical take-off and landing drones to carry passengers. More sites and similar projects are either under way or being planned in other cities across China. These initiatives tie AI and robotics to real infrastructure, signalling technological leadership at home and abroad.\\nWhile China links AI to physical systems, the US leads at the cutting edge but struggles on the ground. US growth, in the first half of this year, would have been negligible without spending on data centres and information-processing equipment. Those categories account for a small slice of gross domestic product but most of the growth. Companies are pouring hundreds of billions into AI, hoping it will unlock productivity gains.\\nThat bet carries heavy environmental costs. Data centres consume more than 4 per cent of US electricity and demand is only expected to grow by the end of the decade. In Virginia, for example, clusters of server farms draw more than a quarter of the state’s power.\\nMany facilities draw as much power as small cities. The largest will require a lot of energy. They also consume vast amounts of water for cooling. Every extra terawatt-hour matters because much of the electricity feeding server farms still comes from gas, so emissions will rise as workloads grow. These pressures fall first on local communities.\\n\\nIn Memphis, Tennessee, regulators recently approved a huge new power load for a supercomputer project. Residents worry about more pollution and grid strain. Similar battles are playing out across several states as utilities scramble to build new gas plants even as renewable projects languish for want of transmission.\\nGeopolitics shapes these domestic choices. Washington has tightened export controls on advanced chips and imposed tariffs on Chinese clean tech. Europe, wary of dependency on both superpowers, is charting its own course. The European Commission recently unveiled a €1 billion (US$1.1 billion) programme to inject AI across healthcare, energy, mobility and manufacturing.\\nEuropean Commission President Ursula von der Leyen wants the future of AI developed in Europe, and the programme includes testing centres, agentic AI development and matching funds. Europe aims to reduce its reliance on foreign technologies and set its own safety and trust standards. The contest is no longer only between Washington and Beijing; smaller actors are asserting independence too.\\nBoth powers face structural headwinds. China’s population is shrinking and local governments depend on land sales, which have slowed. The property sector is overleveraged, foreign investment has weakened and capital is flowing out. Robots and EVs can offset labour shortages, but household consumption still lags.\\n\\nThe US has abundant land and capital, but often lacks the will or coordination to build. Hundreds of manufacturing projects have been announced, promising hundreds of thousands of jobs, yet industrial construction has slowed. Transmission bottlenecks, training shortfalls and tight immigration policies stand in the way.\\nHistory shows that power rests in working systems. British coal and steam defined the 19th century; American oil, highways and mass manufacturing defined the 20th. The 21st century will be determined by whoever builds the most trusted, efficient and adaptive technological systems. China’s strength lies in the scale and integration of its near-monopolies in solar, batteries, EVs and armies of robots, as well as a broad AI research ecosystem.\\nThe US’ strength lies in frontier innovation, deep capital markets and the ability to attract global talent.\\nThe best outcome will be competitive stability, where systems are tested in the real world and other countries can make meaningful choices. That requires honest accounting, community benefits and tough decisions in permitting, property and equity. Hi-tech investment must be paired with policies that protect workers and communities. The quiet contest has begun; its measures are unforgiving.\\n",
