            "title": "Why India maintains a balancing act between US and Russia in defence",
            "description": "India and the United States have renewed a 10-year defence framework, reaffirming their strategic partnership despite simmering tensions over trade and Delhi’s deepening defence ties with Russia.\\nThe timing of the signing has put a spotlight on the balancing act required to maintain India–US defence ties, in which Delhi’s pursuit of American weapon systems is complicated by its deepening military dependence on Moscow, according to analysts.\\nThe agreement was signed on Friday in Kuala Lumpur by Indian Defence Minister Rajnath Singh and US Secretary of War Pete Hegseth, who hailed it as a milestone for bilateral military cooperation. They were holding talks on the sidelines of the Asean Defence Ministers’ Meeting-Plus in the Malaysian capital.\\n“This advances our defence partnership, a cornerstone for regional stability and deterrence. We’re enhancing our coordination, info sharing, and tech cooperation. Our defence ties have never been stronger,” Hegseth posted on social media.\\nRelations between New Delhi and Washington have deteriorated over the past few months, after the US imposed a 50 per cent import tariff on Indian exports, partly as penalties for India’s purchases of Russian oil.\\nDespite the tensions, the two sides have maintained their defence ties and continued to hold joint military exercises. They have also been trying to finalise a trade agreement.\\n\\nWhile the defence framework was extended for the third time on Friday, the timing of its signing was significant, said Vivek Mishra, deputy director of strategic studies at the Observer Research Foundation.\\n“At the political level, it is a strong signal that engagement from both sides continues as normal,” he said, adding that it augured well for bilateral ties at a broad level amid their trade discussions.\\nIndia has been looking to Russia for its supply of weapons even as it seeks to ease trade tensions with the US.\\nDelhi is reportedly planning to buy more units of Russia’s S-400 Triumf missile system to boost its air defence capabilities, according to local media reports. Following a contract signed in 2018, India has acquired five units of the S-400 system, with the option of buying five more at the same price.\\nThe Russian system played a significant role during a brief clash between India and its arch-rival Pakistan in May.\\nWhatever weapons India plans to buy from the US would depend on its assessment of the different platforms that best suit its defence needs, according to Mishra.\\nThe Indian military has leaned towards US systems for surveillance and reconnaissance, but is less keen on American air defence systems, he added.\\n\\nIndia has also not indicated whether it would like to buy American-made F-35 stealth fighter planes despite US President Donald Trump having offered the aircraft for sale to Delhi.\\nThere have been reports that India may look to buy Russian-made Su-57 aircraft even as it is looking to build its own advanced medium combat aircraft.\\nRussia’s willingness to transfer its latest military technology to India would be viewed favourably by Delhi because it wants to be more self-reliant in weapons development by buying less from its external suppliers and building its defence sector, according to analysts.\\nIn contrast, the US had not been willing to share its technology with India, Mishra noted. Nonetheless, he suggested more joint ventures between the two countries under the renewed defence framework to solidify their ties. Satellite-based communications and infantry combat vehicles are among the areas that both sides can collaborate on, according to Mishra.\\nIndian conglomerates like the Tata Group and Mahindra &amp; Mahindra are currently partnering with their American counterparts to manufacture parts of the C-130 J Super Hercules transport aircraft, the fuselage of Apache helicopters and underwater vehicles.\\nIf Washington were to treat India as a strategic partner by sharing more technology, it could help reduce the trust deficit between the two countries, Mishra said.\\n\\n\\nAnalysts have noted that Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi skipped the recently concluded Asean summit in Kuala Lumpur as he reportedly wanted to avoid a meeting with Trump. India has insisted that the ceasefire reached with Pakistan in May was primarily due to the efforts of the two sides, contrary to Trump’s claims that he played a leading role in ending the conflict.\\nWashington has long positioned India as a geopolitical counterweight to China in the Indo-Pacific region. Earlier on Friday, Hegseth voiced concerns in talks with Chinese Defence Minister Dong Jun about Beijing’s naval activity around the South China Sea.\\nTies between India and the US have also been strained by the perceived aim of Washington to draw itself closer to Islamabad, including securing Pakistan’s critical mineral resources and access to its ports, according to analysts.\\nPriyajit Debsarkar, a London-based political and security analyst on South Asia, said: “These things have to be taken into consideration. If the US thinks that it can sail on two boats, then it probably won’t work.”\\n",

            "description": "Deloitte China plans to hire about 1,000 people in Hong Kong and invest HK$500 million (US$64 million) over the next four years, as part of a new initiative that is expected to strengthen the city’s role as a regional talent and innovation hub.\\nCalled the “Hong Kong LEAP” strategy, the initiative is focused on expanding the company’s capabilities in fintech, capital markets operations and artificial intelligence – areas that would be key to driving the city’s next phase of economic transformation, according to the consultancy.\\nDeloitte unveiled the strategy alongside the release of its 2025 Hong Kong Economic Outlook white paper, which identified the city’s four growth engines: driving financial innovation, supporting mainland enterprises’ global expansion, bolstering regional innovation and technology collaboration, and accelerating the green transition.\\n“With its unique strengths, Hong Kong stands at the convergence of threefold opportunities: global geopolitical shifts, national strategic priorities and deeper integration within the Greater Bay Area,” said Deloitte China CEO Dora Liu, who noted the city’s potential to serve as a “super connector” between the mainland and international markets under China’s 15th five-year plan.\\nThe new positions to be created by Deloitte China in Hong Kong would involve financial services innovation, capital market advisory and AI development, according to materials provided by the firm.\\nThe company’s latest plans reflect Hong Kong’s efforts to reinvent itself beyond finance and property, as sluggish growth and a shrinking workforce weighed on business confidence.\\nNew investments and job creation by global firms are widely expected to help restore momentum in the city’s professional services and technology sectors.\\n\\nHong Kong topped the global rankings in initial public offering fundraising during the first three quarters of 2025, driven by strong capital inflows and the rise of offshore yuan and green bonds, according to Deloitte China’s white paper.\\nThe firm called on policymakers to broaden the city’s investment schemes to include digital assets, while expanding cross-border cooperation in the bay area.\\n“As mainland companies shift toward exporting integrated capabilities such as technology, branding and management, Hong Kong’s edge is increasingly defined by its ability to align specialised resources with enterprise needs and foster partnerships tailored to specific market scenarios,” said Edward Au, Deloitte China’s southern region managing partner.\\nAbout 77 per cent of mainland Chinese companies had chosen Hong Kong as their global launch pad, according to data from Deloitte. It pledged to continue supporting these firms’ overseas expansion and capital management needs.\\n“With its mature financial system, low-tax environment, and efficient settlement infrastructure, Hong Kong is emerging as an ideal destination for establishing corporate treasury centres,” Au said.\\nThe white paper also highlighted the city’s potential in terms of innovation and technology, as well as green transition.\\nAccording to Deloitte, the Hetao Shenzhen–Hong Kong Science and Technology Innovation Cooperation Zone attracted more than 400 tech enterprises and 15,000 researchers.\\nMeanwhile, the Northern Metropolis could offer new land supply for industrial development and housing fresh talent.\\nIn addition, the white paper proposed the establishment of a clearer framework for so-called transition finance to help carbon-intensive industries decarbonise, as Deloitte estimated that Asia faced a US$9 trillion funding gap for low-carbon transition by 2030.\\n",

            "description": "China’s Gelao ethnic group practises an ancient ritual known as “Feeding the Tree”, a bizarre yet unique tradition believed to ensure bountiful harvests.\\nThe Gelao people are an ethnic group in China and Vietnam, with an estimated population of more than 677,000 in China as of 2021.\\nThey live in the Gelao autonomous counties in the Western part of Guizhou, southwestern China.\\nTraditionally, they rely on agriculture, growing rice in flatter terrains and cultivating various grains in the mountainous drylands.\\n\\nThe “Feeding the Tree” or Wei Shu ritual in Chinese is traditionally practised during two major annual events, the Spring Festival and the Gelao New Year, which falls on the third day of the third lunar month.\\nIt is rooted in the Gelao people’s long-standing belief that all things possess spirits and their particular reverence for ancient trees.\\nThe tradition follows a precise ritual designed to ensure fertility and safeguard the year’s harvest.\\nFirst, relatives and friends gather and bring offerings such as rice wine, pork, fresh fish and glutinous rice to a designated site on the mountain.\\nRed paper and firecrackers are also essential parts of the ceremony.\\n\\nUpon reaching the mountain, participants begin by setting off firecrackers.\\nThey then select a tall, thick ancient tree and begin the worship by burning paper and incense, followed by kneeling and bowing.\\nNext comes the feeding ritual.\\nA knife or axe is used to make three small incisions in the bark of the chosen tree.\\nAnother participant then “feeds” the tree by placing symbolic offerings of meat, rice and wine into the cuts. These incisions are then sealed with red paper.\\nTo complete the ritual, participants clear weeds and till the soil around the base of the tree, symbolising cultivation and prosperity.\\nWhen the tree being worshipped is of the fruit variety, the ritual includes a specific and auspicious verbal exchange during the feeding process.\\nThis goes: “Feed you rice, bear clusters; feed you meat, give lumps.”\\n\\nThis precise phrase serves as a symbolic “contract”, expressing a wish for an abundant fruit harvest.\\nIn some Gelao regions, the tradition is also called the “Sacrificing to the Mountain” ritual, typically performed near a tall, lush ancient tree close to the village.\\nThis practice reflects deep reverence for the mountain, which is seen as a powerful source of life and vitality.\\nOnly adult men are allowed to take part.\\nA shaman leads the ceremony by chanting the Mountain Sacrifice Song, praying for peace and a flourishing population.\\n",

The Netflix animated movie became a mega-hit this summer, and the craze shows little sign of abating. The film’s soundtrack, which includes original songs from the fictional K-pop bands Huntr/x and Saja Boys, has gone viral too. The demon-hunting girl group’s single “Golden”, and the demonic boy band’s soul-snatching track “Your Idol” topped the US Spotify chart in July, beating out K-pop powerhouses BTS and Blackpink. “Golden” also topped the US Billboard Hot 100, Billboard Global 200 and Billboard Global Excl. US charts.\\n\\n\\nThanks to such record-breaking success, the vocalists behind Huntr/x and Saja Boys have blown up. Ejae, Audrey Nuna and Rei Ami, the singing voices of Rumi, Mira and Zoey respectively, recently made a cameo on Saturday Night Live and were presenters at this year’s MTV Video Music Awards.

            "description": "Starring Jennifer Aniston and Reese Witherspoon, Emmy winner The Morning Show – centred around an eponymous fictional news programme – is currently on its fourth season and is the most popular show on Apple TV at the time of writing.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nView this post on Instagram\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nA post shared by The Morning Show (@themorningshow)\\n\\n\\n\\nOne of the most talked-about plot points this season has been the potential revival of a fan-favourite romance with the return of Claire Conway (Bel Powley). The character walks back into the life of her ex, TMS anchor Yanko Flores, played by Néstor Carbonell, derailing his plan to propose to his girlfriend Ariana (Ashley Reyes). In the latest episode, Person of Interest, Claire is on the run from the FBI and seeks refuge with Flores. Viewers were torn between wanting the pair to reunite and hoping he’d stay loyal to his current partner. In a shocking twist, Yanko gets down on one knee for Ariana. Explaining the character’s decision, Carbonell told Decider, “Season one Yanko would have gone away with [Claire]. Season four Yanko is a bit more settled. He’s a different guy.”\\nCarbonell has been quite the scene-stealer this season. So what else do we know about him? Read on to find out.\\nNéstor Carbonell’s background\\n\\nNéstor Gastón Carbonell was born in New York and raised Catholic by Cuban parents, Rosa Ramírez de Arellano Cárdenas and Néstor Tulio Carbonell Cortina, per Hola! and IMDB. A true third-culture kid, his growing-up years were split across Mexico, Venezuela, the US, the Bahamas and the UK. He graduated from Harvard University with a degree in English. His father was a lawyer; his sister, Rosa Maria “Mia” Carbonell, has worked at Telemundo and Fox.\\nWhere else have you seen him?\\n\\nCarbonell’s acting journey began in off-Broadway theatre, per his IMDB bio. He got his start in Spanish-language commercials and was once hired to play Batman at a children’s party but, he told Hola!, was “terrible”. His big break came when he was cast as Luis Rivera in the late-90s sitcom Suddenly Susan. From 2006 to 2010, he played the enigmatic Richard Alpert in ABC’s Lost. In 2008 and 2012, Carbonell redeemed himself on the Batman front, playing the mayor of Gotham in The Dark Knight and The Dark Knight Rises. He won the 2024 Emmy for outstanding guest actor in a drama series for his role in the FX series Shōgun.\\nIs Néstor Carbonell single?\\n\\nUnfortunately for anyone crushing on Carbonell, the 57-year-old is married. He met his wife, Australian actress Shannon Kenny, in 1994, per Hola! The pair worked together on the 1995 TV show Muscle and were married in 2001. They welcomed sons Rafael and Marco in 2002 and 2005, after which Kenny retired from acting. “I am in awe of her, of what she has accomplished professionally as an actress and of what she has done as a mother,” Carbonell gushed to Hola! Their sons are pursuing music.\\n",

Beach volleyball is one of eight sports Hong Kong will host at the Games.\\nBoth the city’s women’s teams were defeated by their mainland counterparts. Hong Kong’s top pairing, twin sisters To Wing-man and To Wing-tung, were on court at 12pm and lost 2-0 to Chongqing.\\nThe city’s second women’s duo, Au Yeung Wai Yan and Yeung Ting-chi, then followed and were beaten 2-0 by Jiangsu.\\nAnson Lau, 30, a PE and maths teacher, had brought Hong Kong Southern District Government Primary School’s young volleyball team to watch the matches, in the hope that the experience would further develop their love for the sport.\\n\\n“We got free tickets from the Education Bureau,” she said. “I’ll teach the students about the game, tell them the names of the moves and the rules, and allow them to feel the vibe.\\n“I hope they can learn to love the game.”\\nLau said she would also take students to watch the cycling and rugby sevens events.\\n“I also play volleyball, so I actually enjoy coming here to watch.

            "description": "US Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth met Chinese Defence Minister Dong Jun in person for the first time on Friday, with both sides saying they are pushing for peace a day after a summit between their presidents brought tensions down.\\nThe discussion on the sidelines of the Asean Defence Ministers’ Meeting Plus in Malaysia was the first face-to-face meeting between the defence ministers of China and the US since Donald Trump’s return to the White House, although Dong and Hegseth had held a video call in September.\\nHegseth described his talks with Dong in Kuala Lumpur as “a good and constructive meeting” in a post on X on Friday.\\n\\n\\nHe said the US did not seek conflict, echoing statements he made during a video call with Dong in September.\\nDong said China was committed to peaceful development while resolutely safeguarding its national security interests, and had the full capability to calmly respond to any infringements or provocations, according to a statement from China’s defence ministry.\\n“We hope the US will implement its statements of not containing China and not seeking conflict with concrete actions,” Dong said.\\nHe said Chinese President Xi Jinping and his counterpart Trump’s successful meeting in South Korea provided strategic guidance for the stable development of China-US relations in their next stage, adding that the defence departments of both countries should take concrete actions to implement the consensus reached by the heads of state.\\nThe Xi-Trump meeting on Thursday was the first between them since Trump began his second term in January. Both sides appeared to show personal warmth and downplay the competitive aspect of the meeting while stating they had achieved some trade negotiation results and expressing an intention to visit each others’ countries.\\n“The two countries should strengthen decision-making level communication to increase trust and eliminate suspicion … and encourage universities, academia and the strategic community to provide support for the two militaries to explore the correct way of coexisting,” Dong said.\\nAnd Hegseth wrote on X: “We will continue discussions with the People’s Liberation Army on matters of mutual importance”.\\nThe issue of Taiwan, which has been included in almost all in-person meetings between Xi Jinping and his US counterparts in recent years, was surprisingly absent from public statements from Beijing and Washington about Thursday’s meeting.\\nHowever, the two defence chiefs brought up the issue on Friday. Dong said the US should be cautious in its words and actions on the Taiwan issue and must unequivocally oppose “Taiwan independence”.\\n“The reunification of the two sides of the Taiwan Strait is an unstoppable historical trend,” Dong added.\\nHegseth reiterated US concerns about China’s activities in the South China Sea and the Taiwan Strait and posted on X that he had met Philippine Defence Secretary Gilberto Teodoro Jnr on Friday.\\n“We will work relentlessly to reestablish deterrence in the South China Sea and advance our alliance,” he posted.\\nThe defence ministers’ statements appeared mild compared to talks between the nations’ defence ministers in May last year.\\nAt that time, Dong warned then US defence secretary Lloyd Austin about the US congratulating William Lai Ching-te on being elected Taiwan’s leader, saying it sent “a seriously wrong signal to the pro-independence separatist forces”.\\n\\n\\nAustin expressed concern at the time about the PLA’s activities in the Taiwan Strait, emphasising that China should not use Taiwan’s political transition as a pretext for coercive measures.\\nBeijing sees Taiwan as part of China to be reunited by force if necessary. Most countries, including the US, do not recognise Taiwan as an independent state, but Washington is opposed to any attempt to take the self-governed island by force and is committed to supplying it with weapons.\\nFriday’s meeting also came amid reports of an ongoing change to the US’ overall defence strategy. Reports suggest that the Pentagon’s new national defence strategy, which is still being developed, may prioritise the protection of the homeland and the western hemisphere, marking a departure from making competition with China and Russia a top priority.\\n",

            "title": "Philippines blocks resale of ex-lawmaker’s aircraft after jets traced to Singapore, Malaysia",
            "description": "A former Philippine lawmaker accused of masterminding a vast public works corruption scheme allegedly tried to move part of his fortune out of reach of investigators by flying his private aircraft abroad.\\nA Gulfstream jet and two helicopters linked to disgraced congressman Elizaldy “Zaldy” Co were sent to Singapore and Malaysia in recent months, just as authorities were preparing to freeze billions of pesos in suspected ill-gotten assets.\\nPhilippine aviation regulators say the aircraft cannot now be sold or re-registered overseas under international aviation law, even though they left the country before formal proceedings began.\\nThe discovery is the latest twist in an escalating corruption scandal that has gripped the Philippines, where Co – until recently the powerful head of the House appropriations committee – is accused of orchestrating fraudulent public works projects worth billions of pesos.\\nThe Civil Aviation Authority of the Philippines (CAAP) confirmed in a statement issued on Thursday “that three registered air assets connected to Mr. Co have departed from the country”.\\n“We are coordinating with the civil aviation authorities of the countries that these aircraft flew to and we are asking them to help monitor because that is all we can do for now,” CAAP Director General Raul del Rosario said at a press conference as quoted by GMA News.\\n\\nThe three aircraft are part of a fleet that includes at least 13 helicopters and fixed-wing planes registered to companies linked to Co. The fleet’s scale has drawn widespread outrage, particularly after comparisons showed Co’s private air assets outnumbered those of the Philippine Coast Guard.\\n“It is disheartening to see a legislator possessing numerous air assets,” coastguard spokesman Jay Tarriela said in late September, noting that the entire coastguard had just three planes and two helicopters.\\nPublic Works Secretary Vince Dizon said the fleet included a Gulfstream G350 executive jet valued at more than US$26 million, which was located in Singapore as early as August 16.\\nTwo AgustaWestland helicopters were flown to Kota Kinabalu, Malaysia, on August 20 and September 11. Co himself was not on board any of the flights, according to regulators.\\nThe remaining 10 aircraft are still in the Philippines and are under active monitoring by CAAP.\\nDespite some having left the country before Co’s assets were frozen, CAAP officials stressed that none of the aircraft can legally be sold or re-registered abroad. Under international aviation law, aircraft cannot be registered in a new jurisdiction unless they are first deregistered by the original country.\\nThe CAAP has issued a hold on the deregistration of all 13 aircraft, effectively freezing their resale value.\\n“You cannot sell it or transfer ownership unless it is deregistered in the Philippines,” Dizon said at a press briefing on September 30, as quoted by ABS-CBN.\\nAttempts by Co’s companies to deregister some of the aircraft in September were blocked by CAAP in coordination with the Anti-Money Laundering Council (AMLC) and the National Bureau of Investigation.\\n\\n\\nThe freeze on Co’s aviation assets is part of a broader multi-agency investigation into alleged systemic corruption in the Philippines’ flood-control infrastructure programme.\\nAs appropriations chair, Co allegedly inserted hundreds of billions of pesos into the public works budget for so-called flood-control projects. Investigators say many of these were substandard or fictitious, with funds funnelled to contractors who delivered kickbacks in cash-stuffed suitcases.\\nOn October 23, AMLC disclosed that it had frozen 5.2 billion pesos (US$89 million) in assets linked to Co and his associates. “We’re still waiting for the submission of other bank accounts and valuation of other properties,” AMLC Executive Director Matthew David said, as quoted by GMA News.\\nCo resigned from Congress on September 29, citing “grave and imminent threats” to his safety. In a statement reported by GMA News, he said: “All I can tell you now is that the accusations being made against me are false … I can only stay silent to protect my family and myself.”\\nHe had left the country in July for medical reasons, and his current whereabouts are unknown. The justice department has requested an Interpol “blue notice” to locate him.\\nThe wider corruption scandal – widely dubbed the “ghost flood-control” controversy – centres on hundreds of budget insertions allegedly made by lawmakers to fund infrastructure projects that were either non-existent or awarded to politically connected contractors.\\nMany of these projects were approved without proper documentation or on-site verification, allowing what investigators believe was a coordinated kickback scheme to flourish across multiple provinces.\\nPublic anger has intensified in recent weeks, fuelled by viral videos showing contractors and officials flaunting luxury cars, designer goods and overseas travel. In response, President Ferdinand Marcos Jnr has formed an independent commission to investigate what is likely to be one of the Philippines’ most consequential corruption cases in decades.\\n",
