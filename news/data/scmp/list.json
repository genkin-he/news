            "title": "UBS, HKEX and Standard Chartered’s women CEOs on blazing a trail and finding balance",
            "description": "In most global financial centres, women chief executives remain a rarity. In Hong Kong, they are increasingly part of the landscape. Among them are Amy Lo Choi-wan of UBS, Mary Huen Wai-yi of Standard Chartered and Bonnie Chan Yiting of Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing, members of Women Chief Executives Hong Kong (WCE) and co-organisers of Monday’s Women Chief Executives Summit in the city.\\nLo describes the beginnings of WCE as spontaneous, just a handful of women meeting over lunch. “We thought we should do something together,” she says. “We are all very passionate about helping next-gen women to excel in their careers.”\\nThose informal gatherings have since evolved into an organised network, formalised in 2018, with 60 women CEOs leading financial institutions and working groups dedicated to advocacy (led by Lo and Huen), education, well-being and fostering young talent.\\nWhat sets WCE apart is its unlikely alliance: competitors coming together in a notoriously guarded industry.\\n“Covid made us closer,” says Huen. “It wasn’t about who wins; it was about how to sail through the crisis together.” As the group grew, she says, they asked, “How do we use the soft power of women to support Hong Kong?”\\nThis week’s inaugural summit was a start, and it brought together 200 women C-suite executives from around the region and the world under one roof.\\nMore than a decade after Sheryl Sandberg and her “Lean In” ideology turned personal ambition into feminist buzzwords, WCE offers a different model, focused less on individual breakthrough and more on structural change and coming together.\\n“For this little city of Hong Kong to be able to produce a group of 60 women CEOs, just in the financial services space,” says Chan, “is phenomenal.”\\nMeet Lo, Huen and Chan, who are leading the change, each bringing her own convictions and beliefs to the role of chief executive.\\nBonnie Chan\\nCEO, Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing\\n\\nBonnie Chan belongs to what she calls “the 5am club”. She wakes up at 4.30am each day, eats a small breakfast and lifts weights at the gym before heading into the office, usually arriving by 7am. In the evenings, she’s on the bike for an hour – cardio as decompression. “That’s the way I keep up my energy level,” she says. “It’s my ‘me’ time.”\\nThat time is as much mental as physical. “The morning session is very helpful. As I exercise, I plan ahead for the day,” she says. “In the evening, it’s about reflecting on what happened and doing a little bit of planning ahead. I find that helpful in keeping my balance.”\\nSince March 2024, Chan has led Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing (HKEX) through what she describes as a period of recalibration amid economic uncertainties. “We were labelled a relic of an inter­national financial centre,” she says. “I think now we are really back.”\\nShe’s not one for corporate posturing. “I’m more interested in what I can do for the team than what the team can do for me,” she says. “Spending quality time with my colleagues, solving problems together – that’s what I really like to do.” Active collaboration is how she keeps up with what the rest of the organisation is doing on a day-to-day basis.\\nIn a couple of years, we’ve added 800 female directorships to Hong Kong\\nBonnie Chan\\nHer route to the top wasn’t shaped by titles or targets. “I don’t think I’ve ever been very conscious about the fact,” she says, when asked about ambition. “It’s more people around me, telling me that I am ambitious.” As a student, a classmate once told her she was always the first to arrive. “I just wanted to be engaged and involved in every learning experience. I didn’t want to miss out on any opportunity.”\\nThat instinct for participation has, over time, scaled up to policy. In 2024, HKEX introduced a new rule requiring all listed companies in Hong Kong to appoint at least one woman to their board – a move Chan backed strongly. “We became one of the very first jurisdictions in the world to mandate that,” she says. “In a couple of years, we’ve added 800 female directorships to Hong Kong. It’s still a small step, but an impactful step nonetheless.”\\nEarly reactions were mixed. “Some said it should be merit based, or that there isn’t a strong enough pipeline, but we did our homework,” she says. “Hong Kong has more women than men. Women receive the same level of education. They enter the labour force at the same time.” Now that the rule is in place, she sees companies looking at a much bigger base for talent. “They’re not just looking at less than 50 per cent of the population any more.”\\nIf there’s a common thread through Chan’s outlook, it’s momentum. “The more women enter the pipeline, the more you build that pipeline,” she says. “It becomes a virtuous cycle.”\\nMary Huen\\nCEO, Hong Kong and Greater China &amp; North Asia, Standard Chartered\\n\\nMary Huen never planned to become a CEO. But when the question came up during an interview, her answer was simple: “Why not?”\\nIt’s a mindset that has shaped the way she works. “You never settle for the status quo,” she says. “I always describe the CEO’s role as about moving the mountain.” She sees ambition less as a drive for position than as a drive for possibility. “Deep inside, you realise: I want to create something new and really make a difference in the legacy.”\\nThat drive doesn’t look the way people expect. “Perhaps some would say I’m too friendly. I’m too collaborative,” she says. “You run an army of 4,000 people. You go to the branch to see them. You’re a cheerleader for the army. You carry a smile rather than commanding authority.” She calls it a ‘quiet ambition’, one that challenges the default image of the CEO. “The purpose and the mission are not different. It’s just the way to express it which differs.”\\nHuen has spent almost her entire working life at Standard Chartered. “This is my second job,” she says. “I was a management trainee in an American bank. I met my husband there, so we said it is a concentration risk.” At Standard Chartered, she moved from marketing to lending and credit cards to investment and private banking. “Every one of those roles had its challenges,” she says. “Like yoga, you stretch, and after that, you feel more relaxed.”\\nI want to create something new and really make a difference in the legacy\\nMary Huen\\nThe biggest stretch came when she stepped into a regional leadership role that moved her beyond Hong Kong. She quickly realised that her usual instincts didn’t always translate. “In the beginning, I tended to use the Hong Kong experience,” she says. “It didn’t work.” What worked was listening and learning how others see the world. “You have to understand their lens to support them.”\\nThat same openness helped her lead the creation of Mox, Standard Chartered’s digital bank. “People said, ‘It’s very, very difficult. You’re the first to do that. Is it too high of an ambition for us?’” she recalls. “I just kept asking, ‘Why not?’”\\nHer focus now is on making space for new ideas and for the next generation. “Don’t expect what got you here will also get them here,” she says of the next wave of leadership. “They want flexibility. They are entrepreneurial. They are digitally savvy.”\\nThat shift, she believes, demands new structures inside old institutions. “Skills are important, but I’m less worried about them,” she says. “How can we create an environment where they feel they have the psychological safety to speak their minds?”\\nAway from work, Huen is deliberate about recharging. “I cook with my family, go on trips, gather for meals,” she says. “That kind of time injects new energy.”\\nBut when she truly wants to switch off, she heads to Africa – not for business, but for the quiet. “Sitting in the dark, facing nature … you’re not reflecting on your career,” she says of her love for safaris, “it’s about your personal journey.”\\nAmy Lo\\nChairman, UBS Global Wealth Management Asia Head and CEO, UBS Hong Kong\\n\\nAmy Lo is often asked how she sustains the pace. She’s been at UBS for 30 years, and now leads its Asia-Pacific wealth management division and serves as CEO of UBS Hong Kong. “People ask where my energy comes from,” she says. “I think it boils down to passion, and purpose.”\\nThat sense of purpose shapes how she approaches leadership. “My purpose when I wake up is to make a difference both to the client – helping them to achieve their own purpose in life, legacy, succession, growth – and to the team,” she says. “Bringing the fun part and the pride of working for UBS. And to really take people under your wing to help them to be successful.”\\nThe third piece, she adds, is about impact beyond the office. Since the UBS-Credit Suisse merger, completed last year, “we are managing over US$6 trillion of assets”, she notes. “That gave us both aspirations and a sense of corporate responsibility: how are we going to turn this capital into philanthropic capital?” She serves on the board of the UBS Optimus Foundation, where she collaborates with clients on strategies that address global challenges.\\nOver time, she’s watched the idea of legacy expand beyond wealth transfer. “In previous generations, a lot of principals cared about maintaining the family legacy – all the wealth would stay with the family and the succession planning would be within the family,” she says. “Over the years, the idea of legacy goes beyond just family. It’s beyond just quantitative legacy; it’s what kind of family values and what kind of contribution to the community you want to pass on.”\\nPeople ask where my energy comes from ... it boils down to passion, and purpose\\nAmy Lo\\nThat shift has been accelerated by the next generation. “Nowadays, [there’s a focus on] topics like climate change, ESG [environmental, social and governance] and anything that is sustainable, scalable and impactful,” she says. “It’s beyond just the family. It’s, ‘Am I helping address the world’s problems?’”\\nWhen she entered the industry, that kind of language was rare, and so were women in senior roles. “When I started, it was very much a male-dominated industry,” she says. “That’s the reason why, as a woman from Asia, I was quite determined to make sure that we have fair representation both in the region as well as globally.”\\nMentors – some of them colleagues, some long-time clients – have played a key role in her career. “A lot of them are very successful female entrepreneurs,” she says. “That gave me a lot of inspiration.”\\nLo is disciplined about balance. She plays golf early in the morning, often before work. “It helps me clear my mind,” she says. She loves to cook (“Lobster noodles are a favourite”), travel with friends and family, and spend time with her seven dogs.\\n“You have to take care of yourself, body and mind,” she says. “That’s what keeps you going.”\\n",

            "description": "China’s Ministry of Commerce on Saturday said it is looking to exempt some Nexperia orders from an export ban that it imposed after the Netherlands seized control of the Chinese-owned Dutch chipmaker.\\n“We will comprehensively consider the actual situation of enterprises and grant exemptions to exports that meet the criteria,” a ministry representative said in a statement.\\nAccording to the ministry, exemptions were being considered to stabilise the supply of Nexperia chips in global supply chains. It encouraged affected companies to reach out and request such an exemption.\\nBeijing’s latest action reflects some of the inroads made between Chinese President Xi Jinping and his US counterpart, Donald Trump, during their meeting on Thursday in Busan, South Korea.\\nA report by The Wall Street Journal on Saturday said Nexperia would resume sending chips under a framework agreement reached during the Xi-Trump talks.\\nAfter the meeting, the Ministry of Commerce said Washington would temporarily halt the implementation of its so-called 50 per cent subsidiary rule.\\nIntroduced in late September, the rule expanded US export restrictions to any company that was at least 50 per cent owned by entities on Washington’s trade blacklist. Wingtech Technology, the Chinese owner of Nexperia, was added to the blacklist in December last year.\\n\\nIn response to Dutch authorities’ takeover of Nexperia on September 30, citing national security concerns, Beijing on October 4 issued a ban on Nexperia China and its subcontractors from exporting finished components produced in the country.\\nAbout 70 per cent of all Nexperia products are assembled in its factory in Dongguan, in southern Guangdong province.\\nBeijing’s one-year export ban was expected to complicate efforts to settle the row over Nexperia, a critical supplier of semiconductors for automotive, industrial, mobile and consumer applications.\\nIn the Ministry of Commerce statement on Saturday, China also denounced the Netherlands for “inappropriately intervening in corporate affairs” after it seized control of Nexperia, which has led to “a global supply chain turmoil”.\\nThe Hague did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\\nNexperia’s China production facility in Dongguan had sharply scaled down production, according to a Monday report by the Post.\\nThe Dutch chipmaker had informed Japanese car component makers that it may not be able to guarantee chip deliveries, the Japan Automobile Manufacturers Association said last week. Volkswagen also warned that disruptions to Nexperia’s chip supply could affect its production.\\nMeanwhile, Japanese carmaker Honda’s plants in the US and Mexico have hit a production hiatus over the chip shortage caused by the Nexperia row, according to separate reports by The Wall Street Journal and Nikkei Asia.\\nNexperia’s China unit had openly defied directives from the Dutch head office, telling employees and customers that it intended to operate independently.\\n",

            "title": "Rosewood Schloss Fuschl is a 15th-century Austrian castle turned luxury lakeside retreat",
            "description": "Austrians are passionate about many things, from mountains to music, but I was surprised to learn that Schloss Fuschl, a 15th-century hunting lodge turned luxury hotel, is also loved and revered by many.\\nThis iconic landmark holds cultural and emotional significance – it was featured in the popular Sissi films about Empress Elisabeth and boasts an idyllic location on one of the country’s most beautiful lakes, a place where many have fond memories of bathing in the turquoise waters surrounded by the majestic Alps.\\nAlthough Schloss Fuschl was transformed into a hotel in the late 1940s, it made headlines when it was crowned the newest jewel in the Rosewood Hotels portfolio in 2022. A two-year renovation followed as the public waited with bated breath to see what would become of their beloved castle.\\n\\nAs soon as I arrive at the hotel, I feel as though I’ve been transported onto a film set. The extensive grounds are dominated by the original “castle”, which features a traditional turret. There is even a picturesque church as well as a fishery specialising in smoked fish and daily catches.\\nTransforming a heritage hotel is no easy feat as it often requires a delicate balance between respecting the property’s original historical charm and introducing modern elements and amenities. Rosewood has ticked boxes with the hotel’s 98 rooms and suites, which are split between the main building and historic tower. These include six free-standing chalets located on the lake, which are designed for families with their dedicated butlers and plenty of privacy.\\nThe main building features rooms and suites offering elegant and contemporary design touches including the hotel’s signature marble bathrooms. I end up in one of the heritage rooms in the castle. It has a sense of old-world nostalgia with its beautifully restored wooden wardrobe, writing desk and window-side banquettes, from where I can take in the mesmerising lake views.\\n\\nSalzburg is a short drive away, but there is plenty to see and do on site. Four restaurants highlight regional cuisine and local ingredients sourced in the area (they even produce their own honey).\\nThe glass-encased Seeterrasse is my go-to spot with its expansive views and dishes like Wiener schnitzel. The dark wood interiors of Schloss Restaurant take you back in time, but it serves more innovative takes on the hearty traditional classics you’ll find at the hotel’s more rustic outpost, Vinothek. For those with a sweet tooth – Austrians love their cakes – there is the cosy Sisi Teesalon, offering favourites like Esterházy, a layered hazelnut torte.\\n\\nTo work off all the food – or just be pampered – it’s worth visiting the 15,000 sq ft Asaya Spa with two pools, a hairdressing salon and a gym. I prefer being outdoors, so I head for the 11km circular hiking trail around the lake through green pastures dotted with cows and sheep. My visit was during the summer, so I was able to enjoy the seasonal lakefront Seeclub, complete with chic cabanas, umbrellas and loungers. There’s no better feeling than jumping into its clear waters for daily cold plunges.\\nAnother highlight during my stay is a private boat cruise on a traditional Zille – Rosewood’s version is electric in keeping with its goals in sustainability – complete with local charcuterie and sparkling tea. My captain is the hotel’s concierge, who has been working in the area for 20 years, and it’s fascinating to hear all his stories. He points out houses owned by famous residents including Russian oligarch Roman Abramovich.\\n\\nBack on land, be sure not to miss the hotel’s newly acquired art collection of old masters, one of the biggest private collections outside a museum. It’s quite something to stroll down the corridors while taking in priceless works by François Boucher, Friedrich von Nerly and other European artists. Another nice touch is the on-site Sisi Museum, dedicated to the country’s beloved Empress Elisabeth, and filled with memorabilia from the films and other rare items from her archives.\\nA perfect blend of past and future, Rosewood Schloss Fuschl will continue to enchant tourists and locals alike for years to come.\\nThe author stayed as a guest of Rosewood Schloss Fuschl.\\n",

            "title": "Atomic ambitions: Singapore eyes the nuclear option for a net-zero future",
            "description": "Land-scarce Singapore officially remains non-committal about building a nuclear reactor, but experts say all signs point to the city state turning to atomic energy to meet its net-zero goals by 2050.\\nThe discourse around civilian nuclear energy has picked up in recent years, with Singapore studying its deployment, developing expertise and partnering with established companies and nuclear nations such as the United States and France to prepare for a possible shift.\\nThe government, however, maintains that it is still weighing its options and says no final decision on nuclear has been made.\\nIn his budget speech in February, Prime Minister Lawrence Wong pledged an additional S$5 billion (US$3.85 billion) for Singapore’s Future Energy Fund to develop clean energy infrastructure “be it in electricity imports, hydrogen or nuclear”.\\n\\nAsked whether the compact, 735 sq km (284 square-mile) nation should harness nuclear energy to meet its climate goals, Alvin Chew, a senior fellow at the S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies who researches civilian nuclear energy, was unequivocal.\\n“Absolutely. The only type of renewable that is viable in Singapore is solar power,” Chew said.\\n“However, solar power incurs a very large footprint, and with its small land area, it is estimated that solar power can only form about 10 per cent of its future electricity mix. Nuclear energy, due to its high energy density, is the only clean form of energy that is suitable for a small country.”\\nIn July, Rafael Grossi, director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), called Singapore “the most perfect example of a country that needs nuclear energy”.\\n“With a very small nuclear power plant, you can have a level of energy density and production that you cannot match with anything else,” he said, predicting that Singapore could have its first reactor “within a few years” – potentially through cooperation with its Asean neighbours.\\nPublic unease remains a concern, however. Chew said one of Singapore’s biggest challenges would not be technical but psychological: convincing citizens adequate emergency systems exist to handle a nuclear incident.\\n“Regardless of how technology has evolved, no engineering system can claim to be risk-free, and therefore it is still necessary to prepare the public on how to respond to an emergency.”\\nVictor Nian, co-founder of the Centre for Strategic Energy and Resources think tank, voiced similar reservations.\\n“Public acceptance and confidence are important in supporting any successful nuclear power programme,” he told This Week in Asia. “[They] require sustained public engagement, education and a clear demonstration of how modern nuclear technologies differ from those of the past.”\\n\\n\\nTo reassure citizens, the city state on Monday released a government background paper outlining its nuclear capability development efforts, coinciding with the launch of Singapore International Energy Week.\\nThe report emphasised that nuclear power has historically resulted in lower death and accident rates than many other energy sources. Still, it acknowledged that disasters such as Chernobyl and Fukushima had “created a worry that nuclear technology is unsafe”.\\nModern reactor designs, such as next-generation small modular reactors (SMRs), have adopted stricter regulations and lessons from past catastrophes, significantly cutting accident risks. SMRs use passive cooling mechanisms driven by gravity and air circulation rather than external power or human-operated pumps, potentially making them more resilient in emergencies, according to the paper.\\nDesigned for scalability, SMRs have a smaller output, which simplifies safety systems. The Rolls-Royce SMR currently being built in the UK, for instance, will fit within an area the size of three football pitches while producing 470 megawatts of low-carbon energy, comparable to more than 150 onshore wind turbines.\\nYet Nian urged careful adoption of the new technology. “It is generally advisable to observe the deployment and performance of second- or third-of-a-kind projects before committing to deployment to prioritise public safety,” he said.\\n“Achieving readiness for such adoption also requires sustained investment in upskilling the workforce to ensure the availability of qualified professionals capable of supporting safe and effective implementation.”\\nSingapore’s National Environment Agency has already linked up with regulators from France, Finland and the United States, and has consulted the Swedish Nuclear Fuel and Waste Management Company on best practices for the safe handling of radioactive and nuclear waste.\\n\\nWhich reactor?\\nOf the 70-plus SMR designs under development, only two are operational today: Russia’s Akademik Lomonosov, the world’s first floating nuclear power plant, which began generating power from twin 35MW SMRs in 2020; and the Chinese state-owned Huaneng Group’s 200MW SMR at Shidao Bay, which started feeding electricity into Shandong province’s grid last December. Neither reactor is available commercially.\\nWhile China’s Shidao Bay deployment represented a technological leap, the country’s global reach remains limited – with only six overseas nuclear projects – compared with Russia’s Rosatom, which has built 20 reactors abroad as of October, according to a recent report from strategic advisory firm The Asia Group.\\nThat report also noted a surge of nuclear interest across the Association of Southeast Asian Nations over the past two years as regional energy demand soars.\\nJennifer Schuch-Page, the firm’s managing principal, told This Week in Asia that while nuclear power features in several Asean members’ energy transition plans, challenges run the gamut from licensing and financing to supply chains, waste management and liability.\\nStill, “public opinions on nuclear seem to be changing in the region,” she said. “Seeing advanced nuclear projects develop elsewhere in the world is likely to strengthen public confidence.”\\n\\nAfter scrapping its nuclear plans in 2016 over safety and cost concerns, Vietnam revived its Ninh Thuan project last December. On the sidelines of last weekend’s Asean summit in Kuala Lumpur, Prime Minister Pham Minh Chinh and Russian Deputy Prime Minister Alexey Overchuk agreed to accelerate nuclear cooperation, with Vietnam aiming to operate its first plant by early 2030.\\nIndonesia has begun regulatory reviews, while Malaysia has engaged the IAEA on capacity building and, in July, launched negotiations with the US for a civil nuclear cooperation framework known as a “123 Agreement”.\\nSingapore signed its own 123 Agreement with Washington last year. In September, the US added both Singapore and the Philippines to its list of countries authorised to recieve nuclear technology exports, a key step towards future commercial collaboration.\\nOn Monday, Singapore’s Energy Market Authority signed new deals with the Idaho National Laboratory and Battelle Memorial Institute, two American nuclear research organisations, to strengthen its technical capabilities.\\nThis Week in Asia has contacted the authority for comment on whether geopolitical factors affect Singapore’s partnership choices.\\nIf Singapore does move ahead, it would do so as a newcomer outside the Nuclear Suppliers Group export control regime, meaning it must work with supplier nations to ensure compliance with international safety, security and safeguards standards. Chew estimated that, based on the IAEA’s milestone framework, building a reactor could take between 10 and 15 years.\\nOnly a handful of countries export commercial nuclear reactors. These include China, the US, France and Russia.\\n\\nIn September, Foreign Minister Vivian Balakrishnan cautioned against a binary mindset that Singapore must choose between Washington and Beijing for advanced technology.\\n“We are a technocratic and technophilic system,” he said. “I don’t care where it [the technology] comes from, but we will do business honestly, and we will not play games, and we will live up to our word.”\\nNian agreed, describing Singapore’s approach as “technology and vendor-neutral” – focused on what works best rather than allegiance.\\nChew added that political support would also be needed, pointing to how the US had backed Japan’s controversial release of treated Fukushima waste water as an example of diplomatic weight shaping outcomes.\\nUltimately, experts say Singapore’s nuclear future, if it arrives, will go far beyond the reactor itself. It will depend on mastering an ecosystem of expertise, fuel supply, regulatory rigour and waste management.\\n“Singapore is likely to adopt a strategy to learn from the best practices in the US, China and other leading nuclear states, while developing a programme that would work in Singapore’s context,” Nian said.\\n",

            "description": "Details of the first joint Russian-Chinese submarine exercise have been published in a military magazine, which said the two countries had shared sonar data and carried out rescue exercises.\\nThe exercise in early August involved two Kilo-class diesel-electric attack submarines, the Russian Volkhov and Chinese Great Wall 210, with two Russian surface ships providing support throughout the exercise.\\nThe 15-day exercise took place after the Joint Sea 2025 exercise involving the two navies in the Sea of Japan, also known as the East Sea.\\nAccording to China’s Ordnance Industry Science Technology magazine, the two subs passed through the Tsushima Strait that divides South Korea and Japan, entering the East China Sea before finally returning to their bases, covering around 2,000 nautical miles (3,700km or 2,302 miles) in total.\\n“[It] sent a clear message to the United States … underwater dominance in the western Pacific is no longer to be monopolised by a single power,” the magazine said, adding that the exercise had also shown the high levels of strategic trust between the two countries.\\nThe series of operations near Japan, held around the anniversary of the country’s surrender in World War II, was also a gesture against the US-Japan alliance, the report said.\\nAs part of the patrol, the two submarines practised detecting simulated enemy submarines, while also sharing sonar data.\\nThey also carried out a “mutual rescue” drill and were joined by one Russian and one Chinese rescue boat to deal with emergency calls from the other countries’ subs – an exercise that required information sharing and interoperability, the report added.\\nThe two sides also shared air defence radar data to intercept targets during the earlier joint exercise and shared key sensor data on anti-submarine warfare.\\nAll these exchanges of highly sensitive information underscored “a deep mutual trust in core military areas”, the report said.\\nIt also said that before the exercises, the Great Wall 210 had shown its stealth qualities by successfully passing through the heavily monitored Tsushima Strait without triggering US underwater sonar arrays.\\n\\n\\nChina selected the Great Wall 210 for the patrol because it was a Russian-made 636 Kilo submarine with similar qualities to the Volkhov, a 636.3 version, the report said.\\nThe Kilo class is one of the world’s most widely exported diesel-electric submarines, featuring a low acoustic signature. It is primarily designed for anti-submarine and anti-surface warfare on the high seas or along the coast.\\nChina imported 12 of the submarines in the 1990s and early 2000s, 10 of which are still active.\\nThis year was the 11th edition of the Joint Sea exercise, an exercise that started in 2012 and has been held every year since then apart from 2018, 2020 and 2023.\\nMost previous editions took place in the northwestern Pacific – including the Japan, Yellow and East China Seas – but some have also been held in the Baltic and Mediterranean. They have featured a range of defensive and offensive drills as well as search and rescue operations and tests of interoperability between the forces – for example, landing helicopters on each other’s ships.\\nSince 2021, the exercises have also featured joint patrols in the Sea of Japan and northwest Pacific.\\n",

            "title": "Hong Kong wartime relics take centre stage in new guided history tour",
            "description": "A new guided history tour, organised by a local cultural enterprise, takes visitors through the fortifications and battle-scarred landscapes near Wong Nai Chung Gap, focusing on Hong Kong’s defence during the second world war against Japanese forces, as the city reinvents its tourism offerings.\\nCreated by Walk in Hong Kong, the tour aims to leverage wartime history as a form of “war relic tourism” to deepen appreciation of the city’s heritage.\\n“Most people in Hong Kong learn about the Japanese Occupation from school textbooks. We tend to think of it as a bitter, hard fight, and while we read about the details, there is not much known content about it,” said Walk in Hong Kong co-founder and chief executive officer Paul Chan Chi-yuen, explaining the purpose of designing this tour.\\nHe also said many places around the world highlighted their war relics as a form of tourism, noting that he believed Hong Kong could do the same.\\nDuring his latest policy address in September, Chief Executive John Lee Ka-chiu pledged to develop a variety of new visitor attractions, including an initiative called “Chinese Cultural Celebrities Rescue”, as part of the government’s efforts to promote “red tourism”.\\nRed tourism refers to tourism products or themes significant to communism.\\n\\nGuided by history teacher and author Rusty Tsoi Yiu-lun, the excursion focuses on the intense fighting around December 19, 1941, when Japanese invasion forces clashed with Allied defenders on Hong Kong Island.\\n“We will see relics that have been neglected, others that have undergone some restoration and some that lie right beneath our feet, so close that we do not even notice them,” Tsoi said.\\nThe tour visits a series of military relics, many of which were constructed during the mid to late 1930s, according to Tsoi.\\nStructures such as gun emplacements, pillboxes and coastal defences were built during the period of “appeasement”, when Britain actively fortified the colony to buy time.\\nA recurring theme on the route was the resilience of the Allied fortifications, often attributed to Hong Kong’s thriving industries at the time.\\nFrom fence poles to water tanks, these structures were extensively built using high-quality reinforced concrete sourced from local producers.\\n\\n“The reason was that we had the Green Island Cement factory and steel bar factories, which made the materials very affordable,” Tsoi said.\\n“So this, in fact, is also very telling of the kinds of industries Hong Kong had in the 1930s.\\n“This was our unique advantage because at that time, the Green Island Cement factory had already been in Hong Kong for half a century.”\\nAccording to the tour, this made the pillboxes and shelters exceptionally robust, posing a significant challenge to the Japanese forces.\\nStops along the way include a former small-arms storage depot, which Tsoi noted is slowly being reclaimed by nature due to lack of maintenance.\\nThe site was originally used for storage and later served as the foundation for a grass-hut mess hall for soldiers.\\nTsoi said that after the battle, the mess hall platform was used to hold more than a hundred Allied prisoners of war overnight without food, water, or medical supplies.\\nAnother site was an ammunition store designed for anti-aircraft guns, bearing several battle marks, including shallow dents from shrapnel and deeper pits from rifle bullets.\\nOne section of the store was designed as a “dry zone” to keep fuses and shells separate and was later repurposed in the 1950s as an emergency first aid station, complete with boxes of saline, anaesthesia and bandages left behind.\\nOne particular pillbox had the unique feature of an observation shaft that allowed officers to spot targets, but it was also a vulnerability.\\nTsoi recounted a story about the Eurasian company Hong Kong Volunteer Defence Corps, in which two people reacted swiftly upon hearing Japanese soldiers on the roof.\\n\\nThe Hong Kong University graduate and his superior managed to warn their unit to take cover near the entrance before two Japanese grenades were dropped down the shaft, thereby saving the lives of the soldiers inside.\\nBullet holes from the gunfire that followed, along with grenade fragments, remain visible on the interior walls.\\nThe tour also highlights new historical findings that challenge previous narratives of the battle.\\nTsoi said that the Japanese advance into the critical Wong Nai Chung Gap was not a pre-planned, intentional strategy to divide the island.\\nInstead, Japanese forces, unfamiliar with the terrain, accidentally stumbled into the gap after being misdirected by the island’s network of catchwaters.\\nThe original Japanese plan to capture the key high ground within 24 hours ultimately took seven days, largely due to fierce and unexpected resistance, as well as their own terrain-induced miscalculations, he explained.\\nThe final stop of the tour is the area around the former command headquarters, which was used by Allied leadership, including Major-General Christopher Maltby and Brigadier John Lawson, the highest-ranking Canadian officer killed in the battle.\\nThe location was where Lawson died.\\n",

            "description": "Feel strongly about these letters, or any other aspects of the news? Share your views by emailing us your Letter to the Editor at letters@scmp.com or filling in this Google form. Submissions should not exceed 400 words\\nThe recent debate over permitting dogs in restaurants may seem a niche issue but highlights broader tensions between cultural sensitivities and evolving social norms in Hong Kong.\\nIslamic teachings place profound emphasis on ritual purity, with dogs traditionally regarded as ritually impure. Beyond religious considerations, public health science raises concerns about allowing dogs in food establishments. While vaccinated pets pose a relatively low risk, contamination from fur and parasites can compromise hygiene standards.\\nHong Kong’s long-standing Food Business Regulation has prohibited dogs – except service animals – from entering food premises since 1994. This law prioritises food safety and protects vulnerable populations. Numerous countries maintain similar restrictions for this reason. Cats generally face fewer restrictions due to different behaviours and lower perceived risks in dining spaces.\\nAllowing dogs inside halal-certified venues risks eroding Muslim diners’ trust in the sanctity and cleanliness of these spaces. It may challenge Hong Kong’s aspiration to be a truly Muslim-friendly destination.\\nThe government recently announced plans to introduce a licensing system for designated restaurants to allow dogs on the premises. Proposed implementation around mid-2026 will create pet-friendly spaces in response to rising pet ownership.\\nHowever, this demands a balanced approach. Policymakers might consider initially confining pet access to outdoor seating areas rather than enclosed dining rooms. Such measured steps would accommodate pet owners while safeguarding comfort and health for all diners – especially those with religious or health concerns.\\nHong Kong must weigh how to embrace pet-friendly trends without compromising the legitimate concerns of its diverse population. Achieving such balance is vital to preserving the city’s inclusive, cosmopolitan identity and its hard-earned reputation as a welcoming place for all.\\nIlnur Minakhmetov, Yau Ma Tei\\nLet’s learn to live in gratitude\\nI refer to the letter, “Rebuild a culture rooted in filial piety and gratitude” (October 24). I can’t agree more with your correspondent, who wrote: “Nowadays, gratitude seems to be lacking.”\\nGratitude is hard to cultivate among Hongkongers. If they are young and at school, they expend all their energy surviving one exam after another. If they are working for a living and already hard-pressed, they can only focus on keeping their jobs and earning money. The aged tend to prioritise their health. Simply put, everyone has their own concerns. There’s hardly space nor time for delicate feelings whatsoever.\\nWhen relationship problems, competition and mental health issues come into play, things get more complicated and many of us become more self-centred.\\nAfter all, we deserve the good things in our lives because we’ve worked hard for them. Who should we be thankful for other than ourselves?\\nIt gets easy for us to disregard the poor, the unemployed and the sick, not to mention all the efforts others have made to make our environment more pleasant and liveable. This is how we end up taking things for granted.\\nActually, there are plenty of people around us we can and should thank, besides our parents. Teachers, for example, exert themselves to impart knowledge and skills to the young.\\nThink of the people who work in different fields – construction workers, postal workers, salespersons, medical practitioners, drivers, waiters and tech workers. Don’t they all deserve our appreciation and gratitude? Without them, life would be quite impossible.\\nWhen we learn to live in gratitude, we’ll develop love in our hearts and charity in our deeds. May Hong Kong become a city of gratitude one day.\\nJacqueline Kwan, Sai Ying Pun\\nTime to go house hunting\\nIt seems real estate prices are bottoming out from their peak in 2021. We could be looking at a turning point in the market as money flows back to the city. As central banks cut rates, investors can be expected to plough their money back into properties. This being Hong Kong, property prices can rise very fast as the scarcity factor kicks back in.\\nThis might be the best time to hunt for and buy assets in Hong Kong. If you don’t catch this fish now, you might regret it next year. That’s Hong Kong for you, a financial centre that can attract global talent and a city with a great vibe.\\nRishi Teckchandani, Mid-Levels\\n",
