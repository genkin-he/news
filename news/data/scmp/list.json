            "description": "Hong Kong will continue to uphold the rules-based multilateral trading system in the face of global economic uncertainty, the city’s chief executive has pledged at an Apec gathering in South Korea, as he encouraged the leaders of Singapore and the United Arab Emirates to invest in major local projects.\\nCity leader John Lee Ka-chiu also pitched Hong Kong’s strengths to officials from around the world on Friday, meeting the managing director of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and several leaders of other countries.\\nLee took part in the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (Apec) economic leaders’ informal dialogue in the morning and was seen chatting with President Xi Jinping ahead of the meeting.\\nAccording to his office, Lee said enhancing trade and investment cooperation was a critical driver of economic growth amid global economic uncertainties.\\nHe also told attendees that Hong Kong would continue to uphold the rules-based multilateral trading system and promote regional economic cooperation with the aim of developing an open, dynamic, resilient and peaceful Asia-Pacific community.\\n\\n“During the welcome ceremony and the meeting, I had brief exchanges with leaders of various economies and invited them to visit Hong Kong more often to learn about our latest developments,” Lee said in a social media post.\\n“I look forward to continuously strengthening and expanding Hong Kong’s network of partners and creating more cooperation opportunities for Hong Kong.”\\nHong Kong officials have increasingly promoted the city’s position as a free port and international financial centre during meetings abroad amid turbulent macroeconomic headwinds and the geopolitical clash between the US and China.\\n\\n\\nA day earlier, Xi met US President Donald Trump for a high-stakes summit, with the two sides reaching a trade war truce on thorny issues ranging from soybeans and rare earths to fentanyl.\\nFollowing Friday’s dialogue, Lee met Sheikh Khaled bin Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan, crown prince of Abu Dhabi in the UAE, a key player within the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC), with which Hong Kong has sought to build ties.\\nTotal bilateral merchandise trade between Hong Kong and the UAE had reached HK$125.6 billion, with an average annual growth rate of 14.3 per cent from 2020 to 2024, Lee noted.\\nLee said that since his visit to the UAE in 2023, the two sides had increased cooperation in numerous sectors including trade, investment, logistics and tourism.\\n\\nHe encouraged businesses from the country to consider establishing a presence in the Hetao Shenzhen-Hong Kong Science and Technology Innovation Cooperation Zone, a new innovation hub the city has co-developed with neighbour Shenzhen and other parts of the Greater Bay Area.\\nThe bay area links Hong Kong, Macau and nine Guangdong cities into an economic and business hub.\\n“I hope that the UAE will support a free-trade agreement between Hong Kong and the GCC as a whole, so as to further facilitate and enhance economic and trade cooperation and exchanges between Hong Kong and GCC countries,” Lee said.\\nLee later met Prime Minister Lawrence Wong of Singapore, often seen as Hong Kong’s regional rival. Lee said they held “candid discussions” ranging from economic and trade relations to people-to-people exchanges and cooperation opportunities.\\n“Both sides agreed that as Asian financial hubs, Hong Kong and Singapore shoulder a key mission in the global economic recovery process,” Lee said.\\n“I also highlighted Hong Kong’s unique advantages and welcomed Singaporean enterprises to proactively explore development opportunities in Hong Kong’s Northern Metropolis, as well as to expand into the Chinese mainland market through Hong Kong.”\\n\\nThe Northern Metropolis megaproject, first announced in 2021, aims to turn 30,000 hectares (74,132 acres) of land into an engine for economic growth and a housing hub.\\nLee also held talks with IMF chief Kristalina Georgieva where he said he expressed thanks for the Washington-based institution recognising Hong Kong’s status as an international financial centre in its latest report.\\nThe report, issued in January, said that Hong Kong’s financial system remained “resilient” although the city’s outlook was “subject to high uncertainty” owing to a sharper-than-expected slowdown in the mainland economy and wider “geoeconomic fragmentation”.\\nIn the meeting, Lee said he promised to consolidate and enhance Hong Kong’s status as an international financial centre while also maximising the city’s unique function of connecting the mainland and the world.\\n“In the face of global challenges, Hong Kong will continue to promote regional cooperation and maintain financial stability and prosperity,” Lee said.\\nLee is scheduled to attend the Apec economic leaders’ meeting retreat on Saturday.\\n",

            "title": "Japan to put hypersonic missile-tracking technology to the test in space",
            "description": "Japan – with China, North Korea and Russia in mind – plans to test its hypersonic missile-tracking technology in space, after its new HTV-X cargo spacecraft completes a resupply mission at the International Space Station.\\nThe spacecraft was launched from the Tanegashima Space Centre on Sunday, carried by an H3 rocket. It arrived at the ISS on Thursday, where it was captured by the station’s robotic arm and docked in.\\nOn board is 4.4 tonnes of food and supplies as well as scientific research materials that will be delivered to the ISS.\\n\\nThe spacecraft will remain berthed at the space station for about three months. After that, it will serve as a flying experimental platform in low-Earth orbit “for exploitation of future space technologies” for up to 18 months, according to the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency.\\nIt will then be destroyed when it re-enters Earth’s atmosphere and burns up.\\nThe HTV-X is also carrying infrared sensors deployed by Japan’s Ministry of Defence, which has said will be used to monitor the activities of a hypersonic glide vehicle, or HGV, flying at least five times the speed of sound.\\nThe ministry earmarked 3.8 billion yen (US$24.7 million) in last year’s defence budget for the project, which it said would use the “space experimental platforms” of Japan’s new space station resupply vehicle, the HTV-X, to detect and track an HGV.\\nAccording to Japanese media reports, a projectile will be launched that simulates a hypersonic missile near Japan to evaluate how well the HTV-X’s infrared sensors can detect and track the projectile’s heat signature.\\nThe Nikkei newspaper reported that if the missile-tracking technology on the HTV-X was proven effective, satellites would be equipped with the infrared sensors.\\nAn HGV is a type of hypersonic weapon that uses a rocket booster to get to a high altitude and speed before the vehicle separates and glides towards its target at hypersonic speed.\\nChina’s DF-17 and Russia’s Avangard are both known to be operational HGV missiles. North Korea also claims to have successfully test-fired at least two HGV missiles, the Hwasong-8 and Hwasong-16B.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAs its regional rivals expand their hypersonic capabilities, Japan is also working to develop the technology. That includes space-based monitoring, since land-based early warning systems have blind spots and would not provide enough time to respond to a hypersonic missile launched from a neighbouring country.\\nJapan is also developing a hypersonic weapon for “island defence” known as the Hyper-Velocity Gliding Projectile, or HVGP – a project under way since 2018.\\nThe HTV-X spacecraft was built by Mitsubishi Heavy Industries for the Japanese space agency. It also worked on the previous HTV spacecraft, which was also known as the H-II Transfer Vehicle and Kounotori or “White Stork”. That cargo transporter carried out nine successful resupply missions to the ISS between 2009 and 2020.\\nCompared to its predecessor, the new HTV-X has a similar launching weight of about 16 tonnes – 6 tonnes of which is cargo load in low-Earth orbit. Its most notable enhancement is an extended operation time that will provide on-orbit experimental opportunities for up to 1½ years, according to Mitsubishi Heavy Industries.\\n",

            "description": "US software company SAS Institute has withdrawn from mainland China and dismissed its local staff, according to a Beijing-based employee affected by the move, as the analytics specialist ended more than two decades of operations amid intense domestic competition and geopolitical tensions.\\nThe company on Thursday announced the lay-offs via an email and hosted a short video call, in which executives thanked local employees for their contribution and cited “organisational optimisation” for the exit, according to the employee.\\n“SAS is ceasing direct business operations in China,” an SAS spokeswoman said on Friday in response to the Post’s inquiry. “This decision reflects a broader shift in how we operate globally, optimising our footprint and ensuring long-term sustainability.”\\nThe company would continue having a presence on the mainland via third-party partners, according to the spokeswoman.\\nAbout 400 jobs on the mainland were eliminated by SAS and each employee was asked to sign a separation agreement by November 14, according to a person with knowledge of the matter. The affected staff would receive a compensation package of one month’s pay for each year of service, two additional months of salary, an annual bonus and pay through the end of this year.\\nSAS is expected to issue a public statement next week, according to another affected employee.\\nThe company’s simplified Chinese website has gone offline, and its career page no longer listed any job openings on the mainland.\\n\\nSAS’ exit marked the latest Western tech company to either scale down operations or exit from the world’s second-largest economy.\\nIn September, US computer giant Dell Technologies made job cuts at its EMC storage and Client Solutions Group operations in Shanghai and Xiamen, in southeastern Fujian province.\\nThat followed a new round of lay-offs at US chipmaker Micron Technology, as part of the company’s global retreat from the lacklustre mobile NAND memory market.\\nEarlier this year, US computing giant IBM shut down one of its major domestic entities, IBM (China) Investment Co, 32 years after it was established. That followed last year’s lay-offs of over 1,000 employees at the IBM China Development Lab and China Systems Lab across several cities.\\n\\nCary, North Carolina-based SAS first entered China in 1999 and in 2005 set up a research and development centre and a user support facility in Beijing. The firm was ranked as the mainland’s “top employer” for 17 consecutive years by Dutch researcher Top Employers Institute for its work benefits and corporate culture.\\n“Our software answers strategic business questions no one else can – enabling you to control costs, drive revenue, achieve capital efficiency and lead with confidence,” SAS Institute co-founder and CEO James Goodnight said during a visit to Hong Kong in May 2001.\\nAt an SAS branch in Shanghai’s Xuhui district, the premises appeared mostly empty, with only a few staff members seen inside when the Post visited around noon on Friday. Plants and office furniture remained in place, while the reception desk still displayed a “Top Employer China 2021” plaque.\\nSAS had two entities registered in Guangzhou, capital of Guangdong province, for its business activities in southern China. The entity SAS Software (Beijing) Co Guangzhou Branch terminated its office lease two months ago, while the other, SAS Software (Shanghai) Co Guangzhou Branch, had not operated at its registered address for at least a decade, according to a Post visit on Friday.\\n",

            "title": "China’s Xi Jinping tells new Japanese PM that conflicts should not define their ties",
            "description": "Chinese President Xi Jinping said conflicts and disagreements should not define bilateral ties with Tokyo, while calling for “a correct understanding of China” in his first sit-down meeting with the new Japanese prime minister.\\nThe 30-minute discussion with Sanae Takaichi, who was formally sworn into office last week, took place on the sidelines of the two-day Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (Apec) summit that started on Friday in Gyeongju, South Korea.\\n“The two countries should properly manage differences by focusing on the bigger picture, seeking common ground while reserving differences,” Xi was quoted as saying by state broadcaster CCTV.\\n“Efforts should be made to prevent conflicts and disagreements from defining the broader bilateral relationship.”\\nThe two leaders largely kept to the diplomatic groundwork laid out in previous meetings between the countries’ leaders, reaffirming their stance to pursue “a strategically and mutually beneficial relationship” and build constructive and stable ties.\\n\\nFor her part, Takaichi acknowledged the array of lingering issues and challenges between Tokyo and Beijing. But she voiced hope about tackling them head on and enhancing mutual understanding.\\n“I hope to engage in candid dialogue with President Xi and deepen the relationship between the two leaders,” Takaichi said.\\nOn Friday, Takaichi said at a press briefing after the meeting that she raised their countries’ territorial disputes, the detention and safety of Japanese nationals in China, Beijing’s import restrictions on Japanese beef and seafood products, and rare earths.\\nTheir first in-person meeting came after the countries’ top diplomats spoke by phone on Tuesday, with Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi referring to “positive signals” from Japan’s new cabinet and urging it to take a solid “first step” in its engagement with China.\\nWang added that historical issues and the Taiwan question were fundamental matters in bilateral ties.\\nDuring the call, Japanese Foreign Minister Toshimitsu Motegi raised “strong concerns regarding China’s export control measures on rare earths”, while calling for remaining agricultural trade restrictions to be lifted.\\nMeanwhile, on Friday, Xi said in his opening remarks that he hoped to maintain communication with Takaichi and “work together to develop Sino-Japanese relations along the right track”.\\nBeijing and Tokyo share strong economic ties as trading partners, but they are frequently tested by historical mistrust, territorial disputes and Japan’s alliance with the United States.\\nIn Beijing, there are growing worries that Takaichi’s surprise elevation to prime minister might strain ties with Beijing because of her nationalistic views and hawkish security policies.\\nIn a sign of wariness towards her hardline foreign policies, Xi refrained from sending a congratulatory message to Takaichi, a departure from the precedent set with three previous prime ministers, including her successor, Shigeru Ishiba.\\n\\n\\nTakaichi has long been known for her hardline views: criticising China’s growing military presence in the region and adopting a nationalist tone on Japan’s wartime history.\\nHer past stance on visiting Yasukuni Shrine – a regular sore point that strains ties with Japan’s neighbours – and her close bond with Taiwan are considered potential flashpoints facing Sino-Japanese ties going forward.\\nBeijing sees Taiwan as part of China to be reunited by force if necessary. Most countries, including the US, do not recognise Taiwan as an independent state, but Washington is opposed to any attempt to take the self-ruled island by force and is committed to supplying it with weapons.\\nIn addition to her frequent engagement with Taiwanese officials in the past, she has picked some pro-Taiwan politicians for cabinet positions, including Chief Cabinet Secretary Minoru Kihara, the prime minister’s right-hand cabinet official. The former defence minister is a staunch supporter of Taiwan and is a senior member of the Japan-Taiwan parliamentary league.\\nXi urged Takaichi to uphold important agreements regarding historical issues and Taiwan, ensuring that the foundation of Sino-Japanese relations remains intact and unshaken, according to CCTV.\\nThe Japanese leader mentioned that Xi raised the Taiwan issue first and that they discussed it.\\nOn the matter of Yasukuni Shrine, Takaichi appeared to adopt a flexible and pragmatic stance, opting to skip visits during its three-day autumn festival two weeks ago.\\nOne of her first acts as prime minister was to announce a defence spending target of 2 per cent of GDP within the current financial year ending in March, accelerating the timeline from the original goal set for the 2027 financial year.\\nAnd in a policy address last week, Takaichi called China an “important neighbour” and said Tokyo needed to foster “constructive and stable” ties with Beijing and promote a “strategic and mutually beneficial” relationship.\\nBut she also emphasised her government’s commitment to bolstering multilateral security ties with the US and South Korea and involvement in the Quad, a strategic security dialogue that also includes the US, Australia and India.\\nA close ally of the US, Japan hosts the biggest concentration of the US military abroad. US President Donald Trump and Takaichi signed an agreement on Tuesday “securing” supplies of critical minerals and rare earths.\\nThe move was seen as a counterapproach to Beijing’s strong grip on rare earths, while announcing the “golden age” of their countries’ alliance.\\n",

            "title": "Philippines’ Heart Evangelista shares ‘humble enough’ quote after new accusation",
            "description": "Filipino actress-turned-influencer Heart Evangelista has shared a quote about successful people who do not step on others, as she continues to fend off accusations of her being a “nepo-wife” and is exploring legal options against her critics.\\nThe 40-year-old is married to Senator Francis “Chiz” Escudero, who was ousted as senate president in September after being linked to the country’s 545 billion peso (US$9.3 billion) flood-control corruption scandal.\\nSince the scandal erupted in July, those with even tenuous links to it – such as Evangelista – have had their lifestyles scrutinised. The fashion influencer has been defending herself on her favourite medium: social media.\\nOn Wednesday, she shared a post from British author Vex King, known for his bestseller, Good Vibes, Good Life.\\n“I’ve stopped being inspired by loud success. What moves me now are the people who rise without selling their soul or stepping on others,” the post read. “Those who achieve incredible things without constantly chasing relevance. The ones who live what they preach and treat people kindly, whether or not the cameras are rolling. Those who know their worth but are humble enough to know they aren’t above anyone else. That’s the kind of greatness I aspire to – quiet, steady, and real.”\\nEvangelista did not add a caption to the post, nor did she mention who it was in reference to, but commenters pointed to a recent criticism by actor-host Vice Ganda, according to the Inquirer newspaper.\\n\\nIn an October 24 episode of It’s Showtime, a TV variety show, Ganda appeared to make snide remarks about the fashion icon by describing a school in “Heart Evangelista’s province” of Sorsogon, Escudero’s bailiwick, as bulok, a Filipino word for decay.\\n“I went to a place in Heart Evangelista’s province, where a school didn’t have reading materials. So I had the school built,” Ganda said, as quoted by the Manila Bulletin.\\nHis remarks caused Evangelista’s personal assistant, Resty Rosell, to defend her on social media the day after, saying: “Please call DepEd [the Department of Education] because DepEd has a BUDGET for the school buildings and reading materials you are talking about. What is your intention in mentioning Heart’s name? For what? Just to have something to say?”\\nRosell then went on to list all the charity works Evangelista had done in Sorsogon, asking Ganda: “Is this the province you are talking about?”\\nOn Wednesday, the province’s mayor Wennie Raffalo-Romano told Panay News: “I would like to emphasise that Ms. Heart Evangelista-Escudero has nothing to do with this issue.”\\nEvangelista also faced another controversy recently when social media users circulated photos of a rare paraiba tourmaline ring she had received from her husband for her birthday last year, along with an estimated 57 million peso price tag and screenshots from luxury jewellery sites for comparison, according to the Inquirer report.\\n\\nComments on the posts questioned where Escudero supposedly got the money to buy such a lavish piece, given that his declared net worth as of December last year was only 18.8 million pesos. “His net worth is only 18.8 million but the ring is 57 million? Math isn’t mathing,” one user posted.\\nEvangelista has previously said she worked hard to earn the money to buy all her luxury goods.\\n“The sad reality at this point, it’s very hurtful to an independent woman like myself,” she said in a live stream in September, according to the Kami news portal. “Goddammit, I am so independent … I am so hardworking and I have pride in what I do.”\\nShe denied she was being a nepo-wife, saying how she hated the label because “your hard work is diminished, your hard work is all of a sudden nothing, just because you are now a mere political wife”.\\nFollowing the recent accusations against her, Evangelista has vowed to fight her critics. “I have been having meetings with my lawyer, and definitely I will not take it sitting down – what some people have been saying about me, not even allegedly,” she said, as quoted by the Inquirer.\\n",

            "description": "Hong Kong exporters breathed a collective sigh of relief following the recent breakthrough in Sino-US trade talks, saying they could now focus on their business plans for the coming year.\\nOn Thursday, Chinese President Xi Jinping and US counterpart Donald Trump reached a consensus to dial down tensions and put on hold a number of thorny issues such as pausing tariffs for a year until August next year.\\nWith the truce, a 10 per cent so-called reciprocal tariffs the United States imposed on imports from Hong Kong and mainland China will remain in effect until August.\\nAnthony Lam Sai-ho, chairman of the Federation of Hong Kong Industries, one of the largest business chambers in the city, said the meeting provided the sector with a clear picture of the tariff cost they should expect.\\n“Before that, they did not know how much they would be charged for the tariff when the goods were on the way amid the quarrel between the two countries,” he said.\\nHe urged the sector to explore and diversify their market in the coming year of the truce to further reduce reliance on the US market.\\n“The US is a market, but the world is huge. Could we manufacturers explore other markets, like China exporting many goods to Africa,” he said.\\nWingco Lo Kam-wing, president of the Chinese Manufacturers’ Association of Hong Kong, shared that local manufacturers finally felt some certainty following months of a roller-coaster ride on trade tensions.\\n“With the one-year truce, manufacturers can now make 2026 business plans with more confidence and flexibility,” he said, adding that he was not that worried about the mercurial nature of Trump as he had kept truce promises before.\\nHe expected manufacturers would shift some of their production lines back to the mainland over the next six months.\\nL&amp;A Lingerie, which produces luxurious underwear almost entirely from its factory in Guangdong province’s Huiyang, said the year-long truce eased her anxiety from looking for alternatives elsewhere to avoid the tariffs, according to director Karen Ng Pui-lam.\\nThe company was trying to reduce its reliance on the US market by tapping the European Union while shifting nearly 5 per cent of production to Vietnam in the past few months, she said.\\nThe US maintained 20 per cent “reciprocal tariffs” on Vietnam imports, higher than the 10 per cent tariffs on China.\\n“It was lucky that I did not invest a lot in Vietnam in hindsight,” she said.\\n\\nNg said that the company had to cut export prices by about 5 per cent, but its business remained stable and profitable so far this year on strong US demand.\\n“The trade truce brightens me and I can travel more for leisure again,” she said.\\nDanny Lau Tat-pong, honorary chairman of the Hong Kong Small and Medium Enterprises Association, said the meeting brought some certainty to the sector.\\n“If they really walk the talk, it means our industry could breathe a sigh of relief. But what happened next after this year and business could operate as usual? It is really hard to tell,” he said.\\nLau said some of the sensitive questions were not touched in the meeting such as the issue of Taiwan, South China Sea and the Philippines, which could easily spark a new round of quarrel between China and the US.\\nHe said half of the manufacturers having the production lines on the mainland already set up operations in Southeast Asia countries.\\n“We were reminded by our trade partners in the US some years before, they told us to set up some lines in Southeast Asia, or they could not place orders to us,” he said.\\nHe expected the trend of setting up production lines outside the mainland would continue to stave off geopolitical risks.\\nPui Kwan-kay, president of the Hong Kong Chinese Importers and Exporters Association, said his members were continuing their efforts to explore new markets such as the Middle East and South Asia.\\n“We could reference how changeable the Trump administration has been. So we won’t stop our exploration,” he said.\\n",

            "description": "A Japanese municipality was forced to withdraw tips urging women to wear shoes that make them appear “delicate” or choose makeup that looks “demure” to secure a partner, after facing accusations of sexism.\\nThe northern Japan region of Iwate faced heavy criticism this week after an online booklet with advice for people looking for marriage caught the attention of a prominent feminist scholar and stoked heated debate on social media.\\nFeaturing a cartoonlike drawing of a slender, long-haired woman with pink-tinted cheeks, the brochure advised women to don pumps and a skirt to accentuate their exposed ankles.\\n\\n“That way you can exude an air of delicateness,” it said, detailing other tips such as “demure” and “elegant” makeup, predominantly white clothes and “beautiful, graceful” hairstyles.\\nThe booklet is “entrenching the division of roles based on gender”, cultural anthropologist Tomomi Yamaguchi wrote in one of a series of posts on social media that was viewed more than 6.5 million times.\\nIwate removed the booklet from its website on Tuesday, citing complaints that some of its descriptions were “upsetting”.\\nWhile taking those voices seriously, “we believe information in it was necessary to support people looking for marriage”, an Iwate official said on Friday.\\n“Nowhere did it describe these dress codes as mandatory – it was just meant to let novice or struggling singles know that this is how many others have been successful” in finding a match, said the official, who declined to be identified.\\n\\nIt wasn’t lost on many social media users that the fashion advice in the booklet, which was written in 2019, was less demanding for men.\\n“Keep your shirts wrinkle-free and clean” and “don’t go out with bedhead” were among the recommendations for men.\\nOne social media user noted: “Talk about the huge pressure imposed on single women in Japan.”\\n“These tips are way more specific for women.

            "title": "In Trump’s rare earths rant, US soldiers find a weary world policeman",
            "description": "“Hydraulic or magnets?” US President Donald Trump asked some baffled American troops stationed in Japan during his visit this week, and demanded to know which was better.\\nThat was during a speech aboard the USS George Washington, before hundreds of American servicemen and women who appeared to have no idea what their commander-in-chief was talking about.\\n“You know, the new thing is magnets. So instead of using hydraulic that you can be hit by lightning and it’s fine, you take a little glass of water and you drop it on magnets, I don’t know what’s gonna happen.”\\nThen he got to his point. “Which is better,” he asked. “Hydraulic …”\\nThat evoked cheers from some in his audience.\\n“ … or magnets?” The crowd went silent.\\n“What the hell is wrong with these people?” an exasperated Trump complained.\\nYou can hardly blame them. It seems Trump wasn’t talking about ordinary magnets, but rare earth magnets. But he failed to clarify and had everyone scratching their heads.\\n“I’m gonna sign an executive order. When we build aircraft carriers, it’s steam for the catapults and it’s hydraulic for the elevators,” he said in a stream of consciousness.\\n\\nBehind the comic moment was some very serious business. The Trump administration desperately needs to reach deals to ease the pressure of China’s announced export controls over rare earths such as neodymium and samarium. Neodymium and samarium-cobalt magnets produce much stronger and more durable magnetic fields than other types of magnets, and that is what makes them valuable. Both have extensive and essential military applications.\\nIn their first meeting in six years this week, President Xi Jinping promised to lower some rare earth controls while Trump would halve select tariffs to 10 per cent.\\nI doubt going back to steam or hydraulics is the answer for the US.\\nNeodymium magnets are used in electric motors and actuators, which convert signals from sensors into mechanical actions in military aircraft, drones, battleships and ground offensive vehicles and electronic gear used by soldiers in combat.\\nSamarium-cobalt magnets can maintain functions at extremely high temperatures, making them ideal for use in jet engines and deep-sea vehicles, in guidance systems for missiles and smart bombs, in satellite and radar systems, stealth aircraft and battleships.\\n\\n\\nLockheed Martin’s F-35, billed by the US as the world’s most advanced fighter jet, substantially relies on such advanced magnets. However, the aircraft is so expensive and high-maintenance that many US allies are having second thoughts about buying them, potentially preferring less advanced but more robust warplanes.\\nIn his speech, Trump made it sound like he was talking about the kind of magnets children play with; he might as well be. Many in his military audience probably knew far more about those advanced military-grade magnets than their president, if only they knew what he was referring to.\\nTrump’s reference to building aircraft carriers may be less straightforward. It’s hard to know what was on his mind. But some educated guesses are possible. After Japan, Trump went to South Korea.\\nTo counter China’s dominance in shipbuilding, the Trump administration has been pressuring South Korea to invest in such capacities in the United States – “Make American shipbuilding great again” (Masga) – in strong-armed tactics similar to what he has been using on Taiwan to produce more of its advanced semiconductors in the US.\\n\\n\\nThe US currently only accounts for 0.04 per cent of global shipbuilding output, compared with 28 per cent of South Korea, which in turn is just slightly more than half of China’s. Shipyards in the US have been hampered by outdated facilities and a lack of skilled workers, both of which South Korea is expected to supply. Shipbuilders Hanwha Ocean, Samsung and HD Hyundai Heavy Industries have all been drafted into the Masga programme with investments worth around US$150 billion.\\nMeanwhile, the US Navy has warned that current submarine and aircraft carrier production is insufficient, resulting in the US fleet being overstretched and facing deployment gaps. That was probably what Trump was thinking about when he referred to building aircraft carriers while aboard the USS George Washington.\\nWhy the US needs to patrol the world and threaten other nations is a good question. When Washington talks about military insufficiency, it really means the capacity to strike anywhere in the world, rather than protecting the homeland, which it is more than capable of.\\nThe residents of US allies like South Korea have baulked at Trump’s demands. Of course, China isn’t playing ball.\\nThey were probably on the US president’s mind when he asked about “magnets or hydraulic”.\\n",

            "description": "Chinese police are working with UK law enforcement authorities to track down fugitives and illicit funds involved in a massive cryptocurrency fraud and money laundering case, but experts see little likelihood for victims to recoup their losses.\\nAccording to a statement, police in the northern city of Tianjin were “doing everything possible” to help more than 128,000 Chinese investors recoup funds caught in a web of fraudulent wealth schemes perpetrated between 2014 and 2017 by a syndicate, which converted cash into bitcoins and property to hide the scam’s proceeds.\\nBusinesswoman Qian Zhimin, alias Zhang Yadi, in September pleaded guilty at London’s Southwark Crown Court, following what is believed to be the single largest cryptocurrency seizure in the world, now worth more than US$6.7 billion.\\nQian, 47, had converted the scammed funds into bitcoin and entered the UK, where she attempted to further launder funds. As part of their investigation, British police in 2018 seized digital wallets holding more than 61,000 bitcoins.\\nA government task force in Tianjin on Thursday called for victims to submit and confirm their information on an online platform, and urged them to wait patiently for the return of funds.\\n\\nThe case underscored the “grave importance of international law enforcement and judicial cooperation in combating transnational crimes in the digital era, especially in light of the borderless nature of cryptocurrencies”, said Andrew Fei, partner at law firm King &amp; Wood Mallesons in Hong Kong.\\nVictims of Qian’s scam, however, are expected to face great difficulty in recovering their losses, according to Liu Zhengyao, a lawyer at Zhiheng Law Firm in Shanghai.\\nUK authorities would first need to determine whether all the seized digital assets were bought with funds from Chinese investors, Liu said.\\nThe substantial rise in bitcoin prices also raised questions about how to handle the increased value, he added. Bitcoin traded below US$10,000 in 2018. As of Friday, the world’s largest crypto token costs nearly US$110,000.\\nVictim compensation in the Qian case would also require diplomatic efforts, which further complicates the process, according to Liu.\\nThe British government proposed the establishment of a compensation scheme for the Chinese victims, while it also sought to keep most of the seized bitcoins, according to reports by The Financial Times earlier this month.\\nThe use of cryptocurrency remained common among criminals, despite the growing mainstream traction of the digital asset industry.\\nEarlier this month, the US Department of Justice seized 127,271 bitcoins from Chen Zhi, chairman of Prince Holding Group, who was accused of running a massive “pig butchering” operation in forced-labour scam compounds across Cambodia.\\n",

            "title": "Photos of glass lift being built on Bali’s iconic ‘dinosaur’ cliff spark outrage",
            "description": "A glass lift being built into one of Bali’s most photographed cliffs has triggered outrage from locals and travellers after viral photos showed construction piercing through the island’s iconic Kelingking Beach – a site often nicknamed the “T-Rex” or “dinosaur” cliff for its striking shape.\\nThe 182-metre-high lift and adjoining 64-metre bridge are being built by Chinese developer China Kaishi Group to replace the steep and often treacherous hike down to the beach on Nusa Penida, a small island off Bali’s southeast coast. The project is valued at more than 10 million yuan (US$1.4 million).\\nBut when images of the lift shaft cutting through the iconic ridge began circulating online this week, many Indonesians were quick to denounce the project as a violation of the island’s natural beauty.\\nCaptioning a before and after photo of the cliff, social media user pendakilawas wrote: “Honestly, it looks so ugly, it reminds me of a foreigner who said he went to Bali or Indonesia’s natural attractions not to enjoy 5-star hotels or any luxurious facilities, but to purely enjoy the beauty of nature.”\\n\\nJujur Jadi jeleek banget, jadi teringat ada bule yang bilang dia ke bali atau wisata alam Indonesia bukan untuk menikmati hotel bintang 5 atau fasilitas mewah apapun itu, tapi menikmati murni keindahan alam\\nKelingking Beach, Nusa Penida, Bali pic.twitter.com/jclM7WSCw6\\n— pendakilawas (@pendakilawas) October 27, 2025\\n\\n“It’s a shame that the beautiful view of Kelingking Beach has been destroyed by the lift project,” local resident Made Sediana told the Bali Sun newspaper. “Tourists come to Nusa Penida to enjoy the beautiful panorama, not the lifts.”\\nHe questioned the need for easier beach access at all, noting that Kelingking is a no-swim zone where accidents are common. Safety concerns were renewed after an October 15 drowning involving a French tourist who entered the water despite warnings from lifeguards.\\n“Many tourists experience accidents because they go down,” Sediana said. “If it were easier for guests to go down, it would be dangerous too. The coastline is narrow there, and big waves come suddenly. The best way to enjoy Kelingking Beach’s beauty is from above.”\\nApart from the environmental impact, many also expressed concern about the project’s permits and licences.\\nIn response, Bali Governor I Wayan Koster confirmed on Thursday that he would be looking deeper into the licensing and permits situation to see if there are any violations, The Bali Sun reported. “If violations are serious, it’s closed.”\\nIndonesia’s Ministry of Tourism has likewise sought to calm public anger, saying it has been supervising the project in coordination with local authorities since the planning stage in 2023.\\n“The Ministry of Tourism also encourages the lift developers to apply green construction standards during the construction process, and in the future, to utilise technology that uses renewable energy sources to minimise the impact of global warming,” Hariyanto, the ministry’s deputy for destination development and infrastructure, said as quoted by Tempo magazine.\\nHe added that the lift could become a new attraction to boost visitor numbers and the average length of stay on Nusa Penida.\\nThus far, construction had not affected the number of visits to Nusa Penida, he said, citing data from the Klungkung Regency Tourism Office that showed a significant increase in the number of tourists visiting the area – from 714,335 in 2023 to 1,108,791 in 2024.\\n\\n“Looking ahead, tourist visits are expected to remain high, even as the construction of the lift continues. This optimism is supported by Nusa Penida’s global achievements as the best beach in the world, as recognised by Tripadvisor in 2024 and Trip Best 2025 Global Water Fun Attraction by Trip.com,” he said.\\n“In addition, with a daily average of around 3,000 to 6,000 tourist visits, the Klungkung Regency government is optimistic that the target of 1.5 million tourist visits can be achieved by 2025.”\\nOverdevelopment has become a major issue in Bali, especially after flash floods in September caused the Indonesian government to declare a state of emergency on the island.\\nMore than 4.6 million foreigners visited Bali from January to August this year, according to Agence France-Presse, outnumbering the island’s 4.4 million residents.\\nThe infrastructure catering to them has prompted “land conversion, chaotic urban management and lax enforcement of spatial planning laws”, Made Krisna Dinata, executive director of non-governmental organisation Walhi Bali, told the news agency.\\nIn the wake of the floods, Governor Koster moved to curb runaway construction by banning the conversion of agricultural land into commercial developments such as villas, restaurants and hotels, The Jakarta Post reported.\\n",
